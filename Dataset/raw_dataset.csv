2021-01-30 22:38:11,HarmlessSnack,Welcome to the Endgame.,"Infinite money. You sit on the toilet and check Robinhood, when you notice GME squeezing uncontrollably. After ten green bars you start to worry. ‚ÄúDiamond Hands‚Äù you tell yourself, but your getting anxious. You try not to look at the rising price, and consider locking your phone, but that only makes your stomach ache. The short squeeze accelerates. It‚Äôs been three minutes. Money begins to physically pour out of your phone. Your bathroom floor is covered in a thin layer of $100 bills. You try to shovel it into the tub but it builds up too fast. You lock the bathroom door to prevent the cash from escaping. The air grows thin, rapidly displaced by the impossible flow of cash. The short squeeze accelerates. You slip and fall in the anomalous stream of bills, pouring from your phone. The cash is now six inches deep, and you struggle to put down your phone, but alas, you hands have solidified into perfect diamonds. The short squeeze accelerates. You struggle to stand as the force of the cash rapidly exiting your phone, stuck in your hand and impossible to put down, begins to propel you backwards as if you were on a money printer themed slip-and-slide. Still on your knees, the cash is now at chin height. To avoid drowning you open the bathroom door. The deluge of greenbacks reminds you of the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, only with money instead of molasses. The short squeeze accelerates. It‚Äôs been ten minutes. Your children and wife scream in rapture as their bodies are engulfed by the freshly minted freedom bucks. Your youngest child goes under, with equal parts delight and horror, and muffled cries rising from the churning cash pool. You pray to DeepFuckingValue to finally sell, so you can follow suit. The short squeeze accelerates. You squeeze your eyes shut to stop the eldritch sight of so much money pouring from your phone, but it does not care if you witness it. It can not be contained. The force of the money propels you with such force you feel a sense of weightlessness as you accelerate off the ground. Your body picks up speed as it slides backwards along the uncrumpled bills. You smash through the wall, hurtling into the sky at thirty miles an hour. From a bird‚Äôs eye view you see your house is completely buried in money. Your neighbor calls the SEC. The short squeeze accelerates. As you continue to ascend, you spot police cars racing towards your house. The cops pull out their guns and take aim, but stray bundles of money hit them in the eyes, blinding them. The short squeeze accelerates. You are now at an altitude of 1000 feet. The SWAT team arrives. Military helicopters circle you. The billionaire class has ordered your execution, and hundreds of guns fire on you, yet you remain unharmed, being forged from diamonds. The short squeeze accelerates. It has been two hours. With your ape-like body now entirely composed of Diamond, the money begins to spray as if directed by a rocket nozzle. You break the sound barrier. The government, pressured by WallStreet, deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cash flow sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you leave the Earth. You feel your lungs start to burn, as you reach the edges of the atmosphere. You narrowly miss the ISS, giving it a new green paint job as you fly past. Physicists and economists struggle to calculate your erratic trajectory. The short squeeze accelerates. The money begins to gravitate towards itself, forming a comet trail of cash. Astronomers begin calling you the ‚ÄúGME Rocket.‚Äù You are lost in space, heading roughly in the direction of Andromeda. You wonder, briefly, if perhaps you should hit the Sell button. A small voice in the back of your shattered mind whispers...

For those people who are fear. Listen! If the short ratio of one stock is talking about over 100%, we must win provided that all retail investors buy and hold. This is simple mathematics. If you give up and sell your stock now, we lose and the hedge fund wins. Don‚Äôt waste the previous effort of bruh here. Strong buy and strong hold.

Please note that it takes at least days or weeks for hedge fund to buy cover the stock. No fear. Bruh! Disregard what the mainstream media and BS said, and simply buy and strong hold GME. YOLO! Keep chasing our dream. Bring GME to moon or even Mars.

If your broker limits buying GME, please don‚Äôt give up and try buying from Sofi and Tradestation. You may contact your account manager of Tradestation for help if you have difficulties of buying GME.

What condescension and hand wringing are you imagining here? You‚Äôre showing just how delusional you are seeing things that aren‚Äôt actually there. If my concerns don‚Äôt apply to you, then why are replying? It sounds like you have an inferiority complex where you think things are being directed at you when they aren‚Äôt necessarily being directed at you. Or you see someone who came from nothing and made millions on his own and you realize that you‚Äôre wasting your life or something. But I didn‚Äôt do anything to you. I haven‚Äôt oppressed you or anyone ever. So please snap out of your delusional fantasies and at least with me, see what is actually happening in this particular conversation.

I remember way back when there were some solid gems of advice on what people were betting on and through the years it almost seems like this sub has changed into a meme-fest thread (although i gotta say i do enjoy the memes from time to time).

I thought about it a lot this week when I bought in high, seeing who was on the other side of this deal as they squirmed and cheated AGAIN and AGAIN to delay the squeeze. Shutting small hands out of even a single share, insulting the retail investor on top of that, scare tactics, etc. 

I thought about my wife's boyfriend's kids when they'd ask me, ""so, did you take PROFITS after all?""

Kids, lend me a couple bucks and I'll tell you. 3..4..5, it's all there, ok. No, no I didn't. I get that some people did and I'm happy for them. Profiting off HFs bad business sense and outright greed is honest work.  

But for me, I looked around at all the bros in the line and I could imagine, yeah, someone might get left out and regret this whole thing and maybe they need the cash, fair enough. It would be hilarious to take huge profits and target the top, but, you know what? I really like the stock.

2021-01-30 22:37:15,RecognitionWooden488,Welcome to the Endgame.,"To achieve a short squeeze in Silver, there is only one solution

\*\* Take physical delivery of silver from COMEX and LBMA\*\*

&#x200B;

1. People should buy and hold physical Silver bullion (coins and bars)
2. Buy and hold ETFs that are backed ONLY by physical Silver (i.e PSLV)
3. Buy futures contracts on COMEX/LBMA and take physical delivery on expiry.

Doing one of the above will remove physical silver from the bullion banks. The banks will  flood the  market with paper short positions to supress the price, but if we keep taking delivery, the short positons will eventually fail because they will have no physical metal to deliver. This is how we break them!!!!

By all means look into the mining shares to increase your returns, but unless you participate in  one of the 3 options above, all our collective efforts will come to nothing.

Buying Options will not help the Silver price, unless you have the money to exercise those options on exipry and take physical delivery..

But if we stand together, like we are now, we can effect change. Not just thru the markets but in DC as well. It is imperative that we continue to stick together because I can promise you a back room deal is being made & law written as we speak to prevent this from ever happening again.

Like I said, I work in the Social Services side of non-profits (not the ""hide rich peoples' taxes"" side) in the Midwest. The struggle is beyond real. Good, honest, hard-working people are fleeced regularly out of the money, and real estate/rent, stagnant wages, and skyrocketing healthcare costs are crushing these folks - there are no breaks for them. ""The path out of poverty"" has a giant student loan debt gatekeeper, too, so if things go south at anypoint, that ""escape"" becomes a crippling ball and chain that gets added right on top of those other pressures. And, of course, they get to watch the coastal/urban elites enjoy these fabulous, leisurely lives that are built off their suffering - as they collect dividends and gains for doing zero work.

Ideally, I hope GME crushes it, and that AMC allows the frugals and poors to actually get a chance to enjoy some gains for a change of pace.

Yeah, AMC probably isn't going to make people millionaires, but maybe it'll net a month or two of IRA contributions' worth of cash and allow AMC to keep a few extra theaters open in places, so people can spend $20 to escape this Orwellian nightmare, off to fantasyland - for 2 hours.",1,0

Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.

2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.

3. Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.

4. Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.

5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.

6. If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.

7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Then consider moving to SoFi, since Chamath is perhaps the one major CEO that's on our side here and is offering probably the best alternative.

8. If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. Google will lose hundreds or thousands of dollars per year from your ad revenue and data collection.

9. Join a class action lawsuit against Robinhood to leverage the losses from the day you couldn't buy GME. Document evidence of owning GME (it will be in your Robinhood history), or any intent of it such as on Reddit about your intent to buy stocks before they locked trading. If you owned a lot, you should join as a Named Class Representative for outcomes specific to you. These are civil cases to redistribute wealth back to you, and could be significant. Only sign up in one class action suit or it could be considered fraud. Details are still coming.

10. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand REAL consequences for this criminal behavior. This matters.

2021-01-30 22:36:44,Jack421x,Welcome to the Endgame.," Let‚Äôs break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:  AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)  Now what everyone is waiting for is when it‚Äôs time to close the positions of shorted shares and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.  Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short position will have to close in 0.5 trading days (Monday)  So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.  But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.  Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.  Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. And, who can forget our grand-som GME?  AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday.  HOLD",3,0

After ten green bars you start to worry. ‚ÄúDiamond Hands‚Äù you tell yourself, but your getting anxious. You try not to look at the rising price, and consider locking your phone, but that only makes your stomach ache. The short squeeze accelerates. It‚Äôs been three minutes. Money begins to physically pour out of your phone. Your bathroom floor is covered in a thin layer of $100 bills. You try to shovel it into the tub but it builds up too fast. You lock the bathroom door to prevent the cash from escaping. The air grows thin, rapidly displaced by the impossible flow of cash. The short squeeze accelerates. You slip and fall in the anomalous stream of bills, pouring from your phone. The cash is now six inches deep, and you struggle to put down your phone, but alas, you hands have solidified into perfect diamonds. The short squeeze accelerates. You struggle to stand as the force of the cash rapidly exiting your phone, stuck in your hand and impossible to put down, begins to propel you backwards as if you were on a money printer themed slip-and-slide. Still on your knees, the cash is now at chin height. To avoid drowning you open the bathroom door. The deluge of greenbacks reminds you of the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, only with money instead of molasses. The short squeeze accelerates. It‚Äôs been ten minutes. Your children and wife scream in rapture as their bodies are engulfed by the freshly minted freedom bucks. Your youngest child goes under, with equal parts delight and horror, and muffled cries rising from the churning cash pool. You pray to DeepFuckingValue to finally sell, so you can follow suit. The short squeeze accelerates. You squeeze your eyes shut to stop the eldritch sight of so much money pouring from your phone, but it does not care if you witness it. It can not be contained. The force of the money propels you with such force you feel a sense of weightlessness as you accelerate off the ground. Your body picks up speed as it slides backwards along the uncrumpled bills. You smash through the wall, hurtling into the sky at thirty miles an hour. From a bird‚Äôs eye view you see your house is completely buried in money. Your neighbor calls the SEC. The short squeeze accelerates. As you continue to ascend, you spot police cars racing towards your house. The cops pull out their guns and take aim, but stray bundles of money hit them in the eyes, blinding them. The short squeeze accelerates. You are now at an altitude of 1000 feet. The SWAT team arrives. Military helicopters circle you. The billionaire class has ordered your execution, and hundreds of guns fire on you, yet you remain unharmed, being forged from diamonds. The short squeeze accelerates. It has been two hours. With your ape-like body now entirely composed of Diamond, the money begins to spray as if directed by a rocket nozzle. You break the sound barrier. The government, pressured by WallStreet, deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cash flow sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you leave the Earth. You feel your lungs start to burn, as you reach the edges of the atmosphere. You narrowly miss the ISS, giving it a new green paint job as you fly past. Physicists and economists struggle to calculate your erratic trajectory. The short squeeze accelerates. The money begins to gravitate towards itself, forming a comet trail of cash. Astronomers begin calling you the ‚ÄúGME Rocket.‚Äù You are lost in space, heading roughly in the direction of Andromeda. You wonder, briefly, if perhaps you should hit the Sell button. A small voice in the back of your shattered mind whispers...

If you give up and sell your stock now, we lose and the hedge fund wins. Don‚Äôt waste the previous effort of bruh here. Strong buy and strong hold.

Please note that it takes at least days or weeks for hedge fund to buy cover the stock. No fear. Bruh! Disregard what the mainstream media and BS said, and simply buy and strong hold GME. YOLO! Keep chasing our dream. Bring GME to moon or even Mars.

\*\* Take physical delivery of silver from COMEX and LBMA\*\*

&#x200B;

1. People should buy and hold physical Silver bullion (coins and bars)
2. Buy and hold ETFs that are backed ONLY by physical Silver (i.e PSLV)
3. Buy futures contracts on COMEX/LBMA and take physical delivery on expiry.

Doing one of the above will remove physical silver from the bullion banks. The banks will  flood the  market with paper short positions to supress the price, but if we keep taking delivery, the short positons will eventually fail because they will have no physical metal to deliver. This is how we break them!!!!

By all means look into the mining shares to increase your returns, but unless you participate in  one of the 3 options above, all our collective efforts will come to nothing.

Buying Options will not help the Silver price, unless you have the money to exercise those options on exipry and take physical delivery..

Like I said, I work in the Social Services side of non-profits (not the ""hide rich peoples' taxes"" side) in the Midwest. The struggle is beyond real. Good, honest, hard-working people are fleeced regularly out of the money, and real estate/rent, stagnant wages, and skyrocketing healthcare costs are crushing these folks - there are no breaks for them. ""The path out of poverty"" has a giant student loan debt gatekeeper, too, so if things go south at anypoint, that ""escape"" becomes a crippling ball and chain that gets added right on top of those other pressures. And, of course, they get to watch the coastal/urban elites enjoy these fabulous, leisurely lives that are built off their suffering - as they collect dividends and gains for doing zero work.

Ideally, I hope GME crushes it, and that AMC allows the frugals and poors to actually get a chance to enjoy some gains for a change of pace.

Yeah, AMC probably isn't going to make people millionaires, but maybe it'll net a month or two of IRA contributions' worth of cash and allow AMC to keep a few extra theaters open in places, so people can spend $20 to escape this Orwellian nightmare, off to fantasyland - for 2 hours.",1,0

2021-01-30 22:36:48,Tarsupin,I woke up like this should I be concerned?üíéü§≤,"For anyone watching the situation on GME, please also consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:

1. Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.

2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.

3. Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.

4. Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.

5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.

6. If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.

7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Then consider moving to SoFi, since Chamath is perhaps the one major CEO that's on our side here and is offering probably the best alternative.

8. If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. Google will lose hundreds or thousands of dollars per year from your ad revenue and data collection.

9. Join a class action lawsuit against Robinhood to leverage the losses from the day you couldn't buy GME. Document evidence of owning GME (it will be in your Robinhood history), or any intent of it such as on Reddit about your intent to buy stocks before they locked trading. If you owned a lot, you should join as a Named Class Representative for outcomes specific to you. These are civil cases to redistribute wealth back to you, and could be significant. Only sign up in one class action suit or it could be considered fraud. Details are still coming.

10. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand REAL consequences for this criminal behavior. This matters.

2021-01-30 22:36:44,Jack421x,I woke up like this should I be concerned?üíéü§≤," Let‚Äôs break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:  AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)  Now what everyone is waiting for is when it‚Äôs time to close the positions of shorted shares and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.  Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short position will have to close in 0.5 trading days (Monday)  So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.  But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.  Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.  Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. And, who can forget our grand-som GME?  AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday.  HOLD",5,0

The number of posts with supposed ""level headed"" advice about how a short squeeze is much more difficult to achieve than we all think, how other stocks are also valuable, and how the strong and powerful hedge funds have much more cards up their sleeve and to ""rethink your strategy"" but still ""Go $GME!! I am one of you guys!"", usually with a few rewards sticked to them, is exploding and will be getting progressively worse in the weekend most certainly.

Does a post sow Fear, or Uncertainty, or Doubt in any way in you? Think for yourself.

Hedge Fund interns have now learned how reddit works and want to part you with your $GME shares.

So when melvin collects 20 switches at inflated prices, he delivers the first 20 owed to the country club members.

So the country club members decide to sell those 20 switches back to melvin for $250. A little more than the $200 they paid, but way less than the town poors are asking. Melvin then delivers 20 switches to the next bunch of country club members in line, and those members do the exact same thing. Melvin obviously takes a bit of a bath on the whole thing, but way less than buying back every switch from the townspeople.

I actually don't know anything about stocks, but i'm trying to think of a way out for melvin in this analogy. Is there a way this could work in the stock market?

Listen up ding dongs, the next few days are extremely important for us to do something and stop prolonging the inevitable. 


Lets get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...

##üöÄüöÄFidelity and VanguardüöÄüöÄ##

You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this. 

##SO MOVE THE FUCK AWAY FROM ROBINHOOD AND MAKE YOURSELF AN ACCOUNT AT EITHER OF THE TWO RELIABLE BROKERS. However do not transfer your portfolio as this can take weeks. Instead use RH to only sell once the squeeze is sqoze  @$4200.69 and beyond.##

TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.

Take these next 2 days by the balls and get yourself a new brokerage. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Sure there's strength in numbers and if you can invest in GME it's a good idea because the squeeze isn't squoze yet, but there's really no harm in the other squeezes and it all still takes from the same old guard assholes.",1,0

You sit on the toilet and check Robinhood, when you notice GME squeezing uncontrollably. After ten green bars you start to worry. ‚ÄúDiamond Hands‚Äù you tell yourself, but your getting anxious. You try not to look at the rising price, and consider locking your phone, but that only makes your stomach ache. The short squeeze accelerates. It‚Äôs been three minutes. Money begins to physically pour out of your phone. Your bathroom floor is covered in a thin layer of $100 bills. You try to shovel it into the tub but it builds up too fast. You lock the bathroom door to prevent the cash from escaping. The air grows thin, rapidly displaced by the impossible flow of cash. The short squeeze accelerates. You slip and fall in the anomalous stream of bills, pouring from your phone. The cash is now six inches deep, and you struggle to put down your phone, but alas, you hands have solidified into perfect diamonds. The short squeeze accelerates. You struggle to stand as the force of the cash rapidly exiting your phone, stuck in your hand and impossible to put down, begins to propel you backwards as if you were on a money printer themed slip-and-slide. Still on your knees, the cash is now at chin height. To avoid drowning you open the bathroom door. The deluge of greenbacks reminds you of the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, only with money instead of molasses. The short squeeze accelerates. It‚Äôs been ten minutes. Your children and wife scream in rapture as their bodies are engulfed by the freshly minted freedom bucks. Your youngest child goes under, with equal parts delight and horror, and muffled cries rising from the churning cash pool. You pray to DeepFuckingValue to finally sell, so you can follow suit. The short squeeze accelerates. You squeeze your eyes shut to stop the eldritch sight of so much money pouring from your phone, but it does not care if you witness it. It can not be contained. The force of the money propels you with such force you feel a sense of weightlessness as you accelerate off the ground. Your body picks up speed as it slides backwards along the uncrumpled bills. You smash through the wall, hurtling into the sky at thirty miles an hour. From a bird‚Äôs eye view you see your house is completely buried in money. Your neighbor calls the SEC. The short squeeze accelerates. As you continue to ascend, you spot police cars racing towards your house. The cops pull out their guns and take aim, but stray bundles of money hit them in the eyes, blinding them. The short squeeze accelerates. You are now at an altitude of 1000 feet. The SWAT team arrives. Military helicopters circle you. The billionaire class has ordered your execution, and hundreds of guns fire on you, yet you remain unharmed, being forged from diamonds. The short squeeze accelerates. It has been two hours. With your ape-like body now entirely composed of Diamond, the money begins to spray as if directed by a rocket nozzle. You break the sound barrier. The government, pressured by WallStreet, deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cash flow sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you leave the Earth. You feel your lungs start to burn, as you reach the edges of the atmosphere. You narrowly miss the ISS, giving it a new green paint job as you fly past. Physicists and economists struggle to calculate your erratic trajectory. The short squeeze accelerates. The money begins to gravitate towards itself, forming a comet trail of cash. Astronomers begin calling you the ‚ÄúGME Rocket.‚Äù You are lost in space, heading roughly in the direction of Andromeda. You wonder, briefly, if perhaps you should hit the Sell button. A small voice in the back of your shattered mind whispers...

We don't hate police, its just they don't really serve our community and write us off like you do, so no point of calling.  The only time anyone ever really calls is to do paperwork since jewelry insurance requires a police report to recoup the loss.

Still, will these hedge funds have to pay higher interests if they set a new short at, say $500? Might that be their undoing? (From what I understand, the interest rate is based on the underlying stock, not the price at which the short position was initiated, so maybe I'm just a retard. On the other hand, this means that the higher the stock is, the more these hedge funds will bleed by having to pay interest.)",1,0

I come from Hong Kong, and I stand with all WSB people. 

For those people who are fear. Listen! If the short ratio of one stock is talking about over 100%, we must win provided that all retail investors buy and hold. This is simple mathematics. If you give up and sell your stock now, we lose and the hedge fund wins. Don‚Äôt waste the previous effort of bruh here. Strong buy and strong hold.

Please note that it takes at least days or weeks for hedge fund to buy cover the stock. No fear. Bruh! Disregard what the mainstream media and BS said, and simply buy and strong hold GME. YOLO! Keep chasing our dream. Bring GME to moon or even Mars.

If your broker limits buying GME, please don‚Äôt give up and try buying from Sofi and Tradestation. You may contact your account manager of Tradestation for help if you have difficulties of buying GME.

I love you all. Love from Hong Kong.

I thought about it a lot this week when I bought in high, seeing who was on the other side of this deal as they squirmed and cheated AGAIN and AGAIN to delay the squeeze. Shutting small hands out of even a single share, insulting the retail investor on top of that, scare tactics, etc. 

I thought about my wife's boyfriend's kids when they'd ask me, ""so, did you take PROFITS after all?""

Kids, lend me a couple bucks and I'll tell you. 3..4..5, it's all there, ok. No, no I didn't. I get that some people did and I'm happy for them. Profiting off HFs bad business sense and outright greed is honest work.  

But for me, I looked around at all the bros in the line and I could imagine, yeah, someone might get left out and regret this whole thing and maybe they need the cash, fair enough. It would be hilarious to take huge profits and target the top, but, you know what? I really like the stock.

\*\* Take physical delivery of silver from COMEX and LBMA\*\*

&#x200B;

1. People should buy and hold physical Silver bullion (coins and bars)
2. Buy and hold ETFs that are backed ONLY by physical Silver (i.e PSLV)
3. Buy futures contracts on COMEX/LBMA and take physical delivery on expiry.

Doing one of the above will remove physical silver from the bullion banks. The banks will  flood the  market with paper short positions to supress the price, but if we keep taking delivery, the short positons will eventually fail because they will have no physical metal to deliver. This is how we break them!!!!

By all means look into the mining shares to increase your returns, but unless you participate in  one of the 3 options above, all our collective efforts will come to nothing.

Buying Options will not help the Silver price, unless you have the money to exercise those options on exipry and take physical delivery..

I leave you with the words from Olivia Newton John

But if we stand together, like we are now, we can effect change. Not just thru the markets but in DC as well. It is imperative that we continue to stick together because I can promise you a back room deal is being made & law written as we speak to prevent this from ever happening again.

Listen up ding dongs, the next few days are extremely important for us to do something and stop prolonging the inevitable. 


Lets get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...

##üöÄüöÄFidelity and VanguardüöÄüöÄ##

You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this. 

##SO MOVE THE FUCK AWAY FROM ROBINHOOD AND MAKE YOURSELF AN ACCOUNT AT EITHER OF THE TWO RELIABLE BROKERS. However do not transfer your portfolio as this can take weeks. Instead use RH to only sell once the squeeze is sqoze  @$4200.69 and beyond.##

TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.

Take these next 2 days by the balls and get yourself a new brokerage. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

If you short a stock at 1$ and it goes down to 0$, you made 1$ profit. But if the stock goes up to 100$, you made 99$ loss.

So the loss potential is potentially infinate and simply has to do with how high the price of the stock gains.

**Get ready for GME and AMC FUD (Fear Uncertainty Doubt) campaigns on the weekend. It's already starting.**

The number of posts with supposed ""level headed"" advice about how a short squeeze is much more difficult to achieve than we all think, how other stocks are also valuable, and how the strong and powerful hedge funds have much more cards up their sleeve and to ""rethink your strategy"" but still ""Go $GME!! I am one of you guys!"", usually with a few rewards sticked to them, is exploding and will be getting progressively worse in the weekend most certainly.

Does a post sow Fear, or Uncertainty, or Doubt in any way in you? Think for yourself.

Hedge Fund interns have now learned how reddit works and want to part you with your $GME shares.

ALWAYS check the up/downvote ratio and read the comments before getting swayed by whatever semi correct sounding bullshit they're spouting. Oh how desperate they now have become.

Listen up ding dongs, the next few days are extremely important for us to do something and stop prolonging the inevitable. 


Lets get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...

##üöÄüöÄFidelity and VanguardüöÄüöÄ##

You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this. 

##SO MOVE THE FUCK AWAY FROM ROBINHOOD AND MAKE YOURSELF AN ACCOUNT AT EITHER OF THE TWO RELIABLE BROKERS. However do not transfer your portfolio as this can take weeks. Instead use RH to only sell once the squeeze is sqoze  @$4200.69 and beyond.##

TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.

Take these next 2 days by the balls and get yourself a new brokerage. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

You sit on the toilet and check Robinhood, when you notice GME squeezing uncontrollably. After ten green bars you start to worry. ‚ÄúDiamond Hands‚Äù you tell yourself, but your getting anxious. You try not to look at the rising price, and consider locking your phone, but that only makes your stomach ache. The short squeeze accelerates. It‚Äôs been three minutes. Money begins to physically pour out of your phone. Your bathroom floor is covered in a thin layer of $100 bills. You try to shovel it into the tub but it builds up too fast. You lock the bathroom door to prevent the cash from escaping. The air grows thin, rapidly displaced by the impossible flow of cash. The short squeeze accelerates. You slip and fall in the anomalous stream of bills, pouring from your phone. The cash is now six inches deep, and you struggle to put down your phone, but alas, you hands have solidified into perfect diamonds. The short squeeze accelerates. You struggle to stand as the force of the cash rapidly exiting your phone, stuck in your hand and impossible to put down, begins to propel you backwards as if you were on a money printer themed slip-and-slide. Still on your knees, the cash is now at chin height. To avoid drowning you open the bathroom door. The deluge of greenbacks reminds you of the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, only with money instead of molasses. The short squeeze accelerates. It‚Äôs been ten minutes. Your children and wife scream in rapture as their bodies are engulfed by the freshly minted freedom bucks. Your youngest child goes under, with equal parts delight and horror, and muffled cries rising from the churning cash pool. You pray to DeepFuckingValue to finally sell, so you can follow suit. The short squeeze accelerates. You squeeze your eyes shut to stop the eldritch sight of so much money pouring from your phone, but it does not care if you witness it. It can not be contained. The force of the money propels you with such force you feel a sense of weightlessness as you accelerate off the ground. Your body picks up speed as it slides backwards along the uncrumpled bills. You smash through the wall, hurtling into the sky at thirty miles an hour. From a bird‚Äôs eye view you see your house is completely buried in money. Your neighbor calls the SEC. The short squeeze accelerates. As you continue to ascend, you spot police cars racing towards your house. The cops pull out their guns and take aim, but stray bundles of money hit them in the eyes, blinding them. The short squeeze accelerates. You are now at an altitude of 1000 feet. The SWAT team arrives. Military helicopters circle you. The billionaire class has ordered your execution, and hundreds of guns fire on you, yet you remain unharmed, being forged from diamonds. The short squeeze accelerates. It has been two hours. With your ape-like body now entirely composed of Diamond, the money begins to spray as if directed by a rocket nozzle. You break the sound barrier. The government, pressured by WallStreet, deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cash flow sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you leave the Earth. You feel your lungs start to burn, as you reach the edges of the atmosphere. You narrowly miss the ISS, giving it a new green paint job as you fly past. Physicists and economists struggle to calculate your erratic trajectory. The short squeeze accelerates. The money begins to gravitate towards itself, forming a comet trail of cash. Astronomers begin calling you the ‚ÄúGME Rocket.‚Äù You are lost in space, heading roughly in the direction of Andromeda. You wonder, briefly, if perhaps you should hit the Sell button. A small voice in the back of your shattered mind whispers...

For those people who are fear. Listen! If the short ratio of one stock is talking about over 100%, we must win provided that all retail investors buy and hold. This is simple mathematics. If you give up and sell your stock now, we lose and the hedge fund wins. Don‚Äôt waste the previous effort of bruh here. Strong buy and strong hold.

Please note that it takes at least days or weeks for hedge fund to buy cover the stock. No fear. Bruh! Disregard what the mainstream media and BS said, and simply buy and strong hold GME. YOLO! Keep chasing our dream. Bring GME to moon or even Mars.

If your broker limits buying GME, please don‚Äôt give up and try buying from Sofi and Tradestation. You may contact your account manager of Tradestation for help if you have difficulties of buying GME.

What condescension and hand wringing are you imagining here? You‚Äôre showing just how delusional you are seeing things that aren‚Äôt actually there. If my concerns don‚Äôt apply to you, then why are replying? It sounds like you have an inferiority complex where you think things are being directed at you when they aren‚Äôt necessarily being directed at you. Or you see someone who came from nothing and made millions on his own and you realize that you‚Äôre wasting your life or something. But I didn‚Äôt do anything to you. I haven‚Äôt oppressed you or anyone ever. So please snap out of your delusional fantasies and at least with me, see what is actually happening in this particular conversation. Whatever delusions you have about GameStop is another issue.

The thing is WSB degenerates have a grudge with hedgies and they are using their main weapon in this fight, which is GME.

I thought about my wife's boyfriend's kids when they'd ask me, ""so, did you take PROFITS after all?""

Kids, lend me a couple bucks and I'll tell you. 3..4..5, it's all there, ok. No, no I didn't. I get that some people did and I'm happy for them. Profiting off HFs bad business sense and outright greed is honest work.

2021-01-30 22:37:15,RecognitionWooden488,Doing my part! Just bought a billboard to run all next week on I-35 between Austin and Dallas!,"To achieve a short squeeze in Silver, there is only one solution

\*\* Take physical delivery of silver from COMEX and LBMA\*\*

&#x200B;

1. People should buy and hold physical Silver bullion (coins and bars)
2. Buy and hold ETFs that are backed ONLY by physical Silver (i.e PSLV)
3. Buy futures contracts on COMEX/LBMA and take physical delivery on expiry.

Doing one of the above will remove physical silver from the bullion banks. The banks will  flood the  market with paper short positions to supress the price, but if we keep taking delivery, the short positons will eventually fail because they will have no physical metal to deliver. This is how we break them!!!!

By all means look into the mining shares to increase your returns, but unless you participate in  one of the 3 options above, all our collective efforts will come to nothing.

Buying Options will not help the Silver price, unless you have the money to exercise those options on exipry and take physical delivery..

I leave you with the words from Olivia Newton John

(Yeah, out there, somewhere, there's other cognitively challenged, educationally subnormal people just like us. Swoon.)

I've set up a GoFundMe for the cause. Every single cent, dime, penny, dollar, euro and pound will be used to purchase GME with all proceeds going to Shelter and St. Mungo's, two amazing UK homeless charities struggling through the pandemic.

Sell limits for the charity donations to be dictated by r/wallstreetbets degen consensus.

I have personal $GME and $AMC bags because my ex-girlfriends' affection-starved ex-boyfriend used to talk about how much he loved the stonk in his sleep. 

I'll keep buying the top, set no limits, and HOLD to infinity. Being economically challenged, I never understood the value of paper anyhow.

2021-01-30 22:39:29,TheCloth,Hold!,"I like the analogy, but something I'm currently not quite clear on is the issue of the shorts not actually having an expiry date. 

Am I right in thinking that the brokers/market makers (I assume) who loaned Melvin and co the shares for the shorts have the right to call in the shorted shares but may choose to let Melvin etc drag it out if they wish?   I'm aware they'll be paying exorbitant interest, but if they're willing to bet that in 2-3 weeks time most retail investors will have given up and sold, meaning the squeeze is off, maybe they'll decide to do that if the cost of waiting out 2-3 weeks of interest is (for example) $1bn, whereas the potential cost of rushing to cover next week in a squeeze would amount to say $3bn?  

Additionally, what's the chance of some sort of dodgy arrangement with the market makers (noting their willingness to help the shorters through Thursday's market manipulation) to ease off on interest or give them more time to unwind their positions cheaply?

Essentially what I'm saying is that when I first got here my (probably incorrect) assumption was that the shorters were fucked because there was an actual deadline that they HAD to cover their shorts and so they would be squeezed then - whereas now I think the situation is more one of attrition and 'hopefully the squeeze happens because they decide they can't wait out any longer', and my concern there is, what if they decide that waiting it out is better than initiating the squeeze.",1,0

Listen up ding dongs, the next few days are extremely important for us to do something and stop prolonging the inevitable. 


Lets get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...

##üöÄüöÄFidelity and VanguardüöÄüöÄ##

You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this. 

##SO MOVE THE FUCK AWAY FROM ROBINHOOD AND MAKE YOURSELF AN ACCOUNT AT EITHER OF THE TWO RELIABLE BROKERS. However do not transfer your portfolio as this can take weeks. Instead use RH to only sell once the squeeze is sqoze  @$4200.69 and beyond.##

TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.

If you short a stock at 1$ and it goes down to 0$, you made 1$ profit. But if the stock goes up to 100$, you made 99$ loss.

So the loss potential is potentially infinate and simply has to do with how high the price of the stock gains.

The number of posts with supposed ""level headed"" advice about how a short squeeze is much more difficult to achieve than we all think, how other stocks are also valuable, and how the strong and powerful hedge funds have much more cards up their sleeve and to ""rethink your strategy"" but still ""Go $GME!! I am one of you guys!"", usually with a few rewards sticked to them, is exploding and will be getting progressively worse in the weekend most certainly.

Does a post sow Fear, or Uncertainty, or Doubt in any way in you? Think for yourself.

2021-01-30 22:38:11,HarmlessSnack,Hold!,"Infinite money. You sit on the toilet and check Robinhood, when you notice GME squeezing uncontrollably. After ten green bars you start to worry. ‚ÄúDiamond Hands‚Äù you tell yourself, but your getting anxious. You try not to look at the rising price, and consider locking your phone, but that only makes your stomach ache. The short squeeze accelerates. It‚Äôs been three minutes. Money begins to physically pour out of your phone. Your bathroom floor is covered in a thin layer of $100 bills. You try to shovel it into the tub but it builds up too fast. You lock the bathroom door to prevent the cash from escaping. The air grows thin, rapidly displaced by the impossible flow of cash. The short squeeze accelerates. You slip and fall in the anomalous stream of bills, pouring from your phone. The cash is now six inches deep, and you struggle to put down your phone, but alas, you hands have solidified into perfect diamonds. The short squeeze accelerates. You struggle to stand as the force of the cash rapidly exiting your phone, stuck in your hand and impossible to put down, begins to propel you backwards as if you were on a money printer themed slip-and-slide. Still on your knees, the cash is now at chin height. To avoid drowning you open the bathroom door. The deluge of greenbacks reminds you of the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, only with money instead of molasses. The short squeeze accelerates. It‚Äôs been ten minutes. Your children and wife scream in rapture as their bodies are engulfed by the freshly minted freedom bucks. Your youngest child goes under, with equal parts delight and horror, and muffled cries rising from the churning cash pool. You pray to DeepFuckingValue to finally sell, so you can follow suit. The short squeeze accelerates. You squeeze your eyes shut to stop the eldritch sight of so much money pouring from your phone, but it does not care if you witness it. It can not be contained. The force of the money propels you with such force you feel a sense of weightlessness as you accelerate off the ground. Your body picks up speed as it slides backwards along the uncrumpled bills. You smash through the wall, hurtling into the sky at thirty miles an hour. From a bird‚Äôs eye view you see your house is completely buried in money. Your neighbor calls the SEC. The short squeeze accelerates. As you continue to ascend, you spot police cars racing towards your house. The cops pull out their guns and take aim, but stray bundles of money hit them in the eyes, blinding them. The short squeeze accelerates. You are now at an altitude of 1000 feet. The SWAT team arrives. Military helicopters circle you. The billionaire class has ordered your execution, and hundreds of guns fire on you, yet you remain unharmed, being forged from diamonds. The short squeeze accelerates. It has been two hours. With your ape-like body now entirely composed of Diamond, the money begins to spray as if directed by a rocket nozzle. You break the sound barrier. The government, pressured by WallStreet, deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cash flow sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you leave the Earth. You feel your lungs start to burn, as you reach the edges of the atmosphere. You narrowly miss the ISS, giving it a new green paint job as you fly past. Physicists and economists struggle to calculate your erratic trajectory. The short squeeze accelerates. The money begins to gravitate towards itself, forming a comet trail of cash. Astronomers begin calling you the ‚ÄúGME Rocket.‚Äù You are lost in space, heading roughly in the direction of Andromeda. You wonder, briefly, if perhaps you should hit the Sell button. A small voice in the back of your shattered mind whispers...

If you give up and sell your stock now, we lose and the hedge fund wins. Don‚Äôt waste the previous effort of bruh here. Strong buy and strong hold.

Please note that it takes at least days or weeks for hedge fund to buy cover the stock. No fear. Bruh! Disregard what the mainstream media and BS said, and simply buy and strong hold GME. YOLO! Keep chasing our dream. Bring GME to moon or even Mars.

What condescension and hand wringing are you imagining here? You‚Äôre showing just how delusional you are seeing things that aren‚Äôt actually there. If my concerns don‚Äôt apply to you, then why are replying? It sounds like you have an inferiority complex where you think things are being directed at you when they aren‚Äôt necessarily being directed at you. Or you see someone who came from nothing and made millions on his own and you realize that you‚Äôre wasting your life or something. But I didn‚Äôt do anything to you. I haven‚Äôt oppressed you or anyone ever. So please snap out of your delusional fantasies and at least with me, see what is actually happening in this particular conversation. Whatever delusions you have about GameStop is another issue.

I remember way back when there were some solid gems of advice on what people were betting on and through the years it almost seems like this sub has changed into a meme-fest thread (although i gotta say i do enjoy the memes from time to time). I'm not saying that there still isn't quality content on WSB as there clearly is but I just feel like that might be heading toward a decline in the near future which worries me.

I thought about my wife's boyfriend's kids when they'd ask me, ""so, did you take PROFITS after all?""

Kids, lend me a couple bucks and I'll tell you. 3..4..5, it's all there, ok. No, no I didn't. I get that some people did and I'm happy for them. Profiting off HFs bad business sense and outright greed is honest work.

\*\* Take physical delivery of silver from COMEX and LBMA\*\*

&#x200B;

1. People should buy and hold physical Silver bullion (coins and bars)
2. Buy and hold ETFs that are backed ONLY by physical Silver (i.e PSLV)
3. Buy futures contracts on COMEX/LBMA and take physical delivery on expiry.

Doing one of the above will remove physical silver from the bullion banks. The banks will  flood the  market with paper short positions to supress the price, but if we keep taking delivery, the short positons will eventually fail because they will have no physical metal to deliver. This is how we break them!!!!

By all means look into the mining shares to increase your returns, but unless you participate in  one of the 3 options above, all our collective efforts will come to nothing.

Buying Options will not help the Silver price, unless you have the money to exercise those options on exipry and take physical delivery..

1.  Freeing up in store space for further product diversification.

3. Rise of E-Sports and tapping into that.  Game space for in store tournaments.  People come, watch, play, end up making in store purchases.

I've seen that fail with SEARS, Lord And Taylor, Nordstrom but they all have one thing in common.  Shitty clothes and bad return policies.  When I worked retail, and everyone should to understand that other people really is Hell, I saw the worst business practices be leading strategies.

One thing in common:  Never updated the stores to match the times.  Each one of them had an old, dirty, a sex crime happened here vibe.  Generally unpleasant.

SEARS:  Junk clothes, junk jewelry, shifted away from real money makers.  Pushing in store credit with high risk customers left a lot of unsecured debt out there.  Poor management and poor customer service.  Liberal as fuck return policy on par with Hecht's which was literally a receiving house for stolen goods at one point.  Sears had a great tool department and auto center but turned most of its locations into knick knack crap stores.  Selling Land's End?  Half the store dedicated to junk clothing line that shares the same sweatshop space as Old Navy.

Lord and Taylor: AKA Hecht's 2.0.  Same shit.  I did doubles working the unloading dock and then sales on the floor.  So they overpaid for poor quality clothing, defective costume jewelry, and compensation for upper management did not reflect the actual work they did.  Middle manager was overworked undersupported.  Upper Manager sipped the corpo kool aid.  Okay so after you unloaded the truck you loaded it up with returns and broken shit that literally fell apart on the rack.  So unsold, unpopular clothing, there was a lot of that, got loaded up as well. It would move on to cheapo retailers, think Marshalls, and failing that boxed up and shipped back to the countries that ironically made the crap for sale there.  The thinking was mitigate losses by selling somewhere.  But all that transporting, time spent packing and unpacking, taking up space and delaying new spring, fall and winter fashions making them outdated when they hit the rack cost them more than just burning it or donating it.

Nordstrom:  Started out high end.  Started replacing high end goods with their product lines.  Shrunk actual high quality clothing and shoes selection.  Nordstrom Rack became the clearing house for crap they couldn't sell.  Men's Suits were incredible if you waited for the ""out of season"" suits to go on sale.  No such thing as an out of season 2 button suit unless its a fucking leisure suit.  Eventually ran itself down trying to cater to bottom dollar customers, which the market is already glutted with that kind of retailer.

How GME is different?  Okay first do you see them pushing high rate store only credit cards?  No.  Do you see them with huge floor space with unmovable product?  No.  Do you see them with a huge floor space and the huge utility bills to match?  No.  Do you see Gamestop with out of control return policies?  No.  

So can Gamestop take it's existing floor space, pivot and reinvent the in store experience?  Yes.  Is Gamestop a distressed stock instead of a distressed company?  Arguably it was a distressed stock, which Cramer himself will tell you is worth buying I've heard him say it.  The above retailers were all distressed companies, that's a no go.  But Wallstreet missed seeing the difference between the stock and company being distressed.

Now for my favorite X Factor of all.  Post COVID life.  Do you think people will flood the malls, bars, entertainment venues, and other spaces after we can all get back outside?  You bet your fucking tendies and rent free basement at mom's house!  Will that need to get out and run free settle down eventually?  Possibly so.  But after nearly 2 years of being trapped indoors the desire to rush out and be anywhere but home is going to hang around for a bit.  So yes I would like to go to the mall, or outlet, enter a Gamestop and purchase something for the novelty of being a free range human again.

I think Gamestop is going to have more plays in the future than after today!",1,0

Am I right in thinking that the brokers/market makers (I assume) who loaned Melvin and co the shares for the shorts have the right to call in the shorted shares but may choose to let Melvin etc drag it out if they wish?   I'm aware they'll be paying exorbitant interest, but if they're willing to bet that in 2-3 weeks time most retail investors will have given up and sold, meaning the squeeze is off, maybe they'll decide to do that if the cost of waiting out 2-3 weeks of interest is (for example) $1bn, whereas the potential cost of rushing to cover next week in a squeeze would amount to say $3bn?  

Additionally, what's the chance of some sort of dodgy arrangement with the market makers (noting their willingness to help the shorters through Thursday's market manipulation) to ease off on interest or give them more time to unwind their positions cheaply?

Essentially what I'm saying is that when I first got here my (probably incorrect) assumption was that the shorters were fucked because there was an actual deadline that they HAD to cover their shorts and so they would be squeezed then - whereas now I think the situation is more one of attrition and 'hopefully the squeeze happens because they decide they can't wait out any longer', and my concern there is, what if they decide that waiting it out is better than initiating the squeeze.",1,0

Listen up ding dongs, the next few days are extremely important for us to do something and stop prolonging the inevitable. 


Lets get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...

##üöÄüöÄFidelity and VanguardüöÄüöÄ##

You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this. 

##SO MOVE THE FUCK AWAY FROM ROBINHOOD AND MAKE YOURSELF AN ACCOUNT AT EITHER OF THE TWO RELIABLE BROKERS. However do not transfer your portfolio as this can take weeks. Instead use RH to only sell once the squeeze is sqoze  @$4200.69 and beyond.##

TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.

Take these next 2 days by the balls and get yourself a new brokerage. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

If you short a stock at 1$ and it goes down to 0$, you made 1$ profit. But if the stock goes up to 100$, you made 99$ loss.

So the loss potential is potentially infinate and simply has to do with how high the price of the stock gains.

**Get ready for GME and AMC FUD (Fear Uncertainty Doubt) campaigns on the weekend. It's already starting.**

The number of posts with supposed ""level headed"" advice about how a short squeeze is much more difficult to achieve than we all think, how other stocks are also valuable, and how the strong and powerful hedge funds have much more cards up their sleeve and to ""rethink your strategy"" but still ""Go $GME!! I am one of you guys!"", usually with a few rewards sticked to them, is exploding and will be getting progressively worse in the weekend most certainly.

Does a post sow Fear, or Uncertainty, or Doubt in any way in you? Think for yourself.

Hedge Fund interns have now learned how reddit works and want to part you with your $GME shares.

Melvin then delivers 20 switches to the next bunch of country club members in line, and those members do the exact same thing. Melvin obviously takes a bit of a bath on the whole thing, but way less than buying back every switch from the townspeople.

Listen up ding dongs, the next few days are extremely important for us to do something and stop prolonging the inevitable. 


Lets get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...

##üöÄüöÄFidelity and VanguardüöÄüöÄ##

You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this. 

##SO MOVE THE FUCK AWAY FROM ROBINHOOD AND MAKE YOURSELF AN ACCOUNT AT EITHER OF THE TWO RELIABLE BROKERS. However do not transfer your portfolio as this can take weeks. Instead use RH to only sell once the squeeze is sqoze  @$4200.69 and beyond.##

TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.

Take these next 2 days by the balls and get yourself a new brokerage. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

You sit on the toilet and check Robinhood, when you notice GME squeezing uncontrollably. After ten green bars you start to worry. ‚ÄúDiamond Hands‚Äù you tell yourself, but your getting anxious. You try not to look at the rising price, and consider locking your phone, but that only makes your stomach ache. The short squeeze accelerates. It‚Äôs been three minutes. Money begins to physically pour out of your phone. Your bathroom floor is covered in a thin layer of $100 bills. You try to shovel it into the tub but it builds up too fast. You lock the bathroom door to prevent the cash from escaping. The air grows thin, rapidly displaced by the impossible flow of cash. The short squeeze accelerates. You slip and fall in the anomalous stream of bills, pouring from your phone. The cash is now six inches deep, and you struggle to put down your phone, but alas, you hands have solidified into perfect diamonds. The short squeeze accelerates. You struggle to stand as the force of the cash rapidly exiting your phone, stuck in your hand and impossible to put down, begins to propel you backwards as if you were on a money printer themed slip-and-slide. Still on your knees, the cash is now at chin height. To avoid drowning you open the bathroom door. The deluge of greenbacks reminds you of the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, only with money instead of molasses. The short squeeze accelerates. It‚Äôs been ten minutes. Your children and wife scream in rapture as their bodies are engulfed by the freshly minted freedom bucks. Your youngest child goes under, with equal parts delight and horror, and muffled cries rising from the churning cash pool. You pray to DeepFuckingValue to finally sell, so you can follow suit. The short squeeze accelerates. You squeeze your eyes shut to stop the eldritch sight of so much money pouring from your phone, but it does not care if you witness it. It can not be contained. The force of the money propels you with such force you feel a sense of weightlessness as you accelerate off the ground. Your body picks up speed as it slides backwards along the uncrumpled bills. You smash through the wall, hurtling into the sky at thirty miles an hour. From a bird‚Äôs eye view you see your house is completely buried in money. Your neighbor calls the SEC. The short squeeze accelerates. As you continue to ascend, you spot police cars racing towards your house. The cops pull out their guns and take aim, but stray bundles of money hit them in the eyes, blinding them. The short squeeze accelerates. You are now at an altitude of 1000 feet. The SWAT team arrives. Military helicopters circle you. The billionaire class has ordered your execution, and hundreds of guns fire on you, yet you remain unharmed, being forged from diamonds. The short squeeze accelerates. It has been two hours. With your ape-like body now entirely composed of Diamond, the money begins to spray as if directed by a rocket nozzle. You break the sound barrier. The government, pressured by WallStreet, deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cash flow sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you leave the Earth. You feel your lungs start to burn, as you reach the edges of the atmosphere. You narrowly miss the ISS, giving it a new green paint job as you fly past. Physicists and economists struggle to calculate your erratic trajectory. The short squeeze accelerates. The money begins to gravitate towards itself, forming a comet trail of cash. Astronomers begin calling you the ‚ÄúGME Rocket.‚Äù You are lost in space, heading roughly in the direction of Andromeda. You wonder, briefly, if perhaps you should hit the Sell button. A small voice in the back of your shattered mind whispers...

For those people who are fear. Listen! If the short ratio of one stock is talking about over 100%, we must win provided that all retail investors buy and hold. This is simple mathematics. If you give up and sell your stock now, we lose and the hedge fund wins. Don‚Äôt waste the previous effort of bruh here. Strong buy and strong hold.

Please note that it takes at least days or weeks for hedge fund to buy cover the stock. No fear. Bruh! Disregard what the mainstream media and BS said, and simply buy and strong hold GME. YOLO! Keep chasing our dream. Bring GME to moon or even Mars.

I like the idea of having a thriving online store and here is why.

1.  Freeing up in store space for further product diversification.
2. Free up in store space for live play game space.  Come in, sit down, play D&D.
3. Rise of E-Sports and tapping into that.  Game space for in store tournaments.  People come, watch, play, end up making in store purchases.

Brick and Mortar isn't bad as long as you don't just stop at ""we'll have an online component and that will save us.""

I've seen that fail with SEARS, Lord And Taylor, Nordstrom but they all have one thing in common.  Shitty clothes and bad return policies.  When I worked retail, and everyone should to understand that other people really is Hell, I saw the worst business practices be leading strategies.

One thing in common:  Never updated the stores to match the times.  Each one of them had an old, dirty, a sex crime happened here vibe.  Generally unpleasant.

SEARS:  Junk clothes, junk jewelry, shifted away from real money makers.  Pushing in store credit with high risk customers left a lot of unsecured debt out there.  Poor management and poor customer service.  Liberal as fuck return policy on par with Hecht's which was literally a receiving house for stolen goods at one point.  Sears had a great tool department and auto center but turned most of its locations into knick knack crap stores.  Selling Land's End?  Half the store dedicated to junk clothing line that shares the same sweatshop space as Old Navy.

Lord and Taylor: AKA Hecht's 2.0.  Same shit.  I did doubles working the unloading dock and then sales on the floor.  So they overpaid for poor quality clothing, defective costume jewelry, and compensation for upper management did not reflect the actual work they did.  Middle manager was overworked undersupported.  Upper Manager sipped the corpo kool aid.  Okay so after you unloaded the truck you loaded it up with returns and broken shit that literally fell apart on the rack.  So unsold, unpopular clothing, there was a lot of that, got loaded up as well. It would move on to cheapo retailers, think Marshalls, and failing that boxed up and shipped back to the countries that ironically made the crap for sale there.  The thinking was mitigate losses by selling somewhere.  But all that transporting, time spent packing and unpacking, taking up space and delaying new spring, fall and winter fashions making them outdated when they hit the rack cost them more than just burning it or donating it.

Nordstrom:  Started out high end.  Started replacing high end goods with their product lines.  Shrunk actual high quality clothing and shoes selection.  Nordstrom Rack became the clearing house for crap they couldn't sell.  Men's Suits were incredible if you waited for the ""out of season"" suits to go on sale.  No such thing as an out of season 2 button suit unless its a fucking leisure suit.  Eventually ran itself down trying to cater to bottom dollar customers, which the market is already glutted with that kind of retailer.

How GME is different?  Okay first do you see them pushing high rate store only credit cards?  No.  Do you see them with huge floor space with unmovable product?  No.  Do you see them with a huge floor space and the huge utility bills to match?  No.  Do you see Gamestop with out of control return policies?  No.  

So can Gamestop take it's existing floor space, pivot and reinvent the in store experience?  Yes.  Is Gamestop a distressed stock instead of a distressed company?  Arguably it was a distressed stock, which Cramer himself will tell you is worth buying I've heard him say it.  The above retailers were all distressed companies, that's a no go.  But Wallstreet missed seeing the difference between the stock and company being distressed.

Now for my favorite X Factor of all.  Post COVID life.  Do you think people will flood the malls, bars, entertainment venues, and other spaces after we can all get back outside?  You bet your fucking tendies and rent free basement at mom's house!  Will that need to get out and run free settle down eventually?  Possibly so.  But after nearly 2 years of being trapped indoors the desire to rush out and be anywhere but home is going to hang around for a bit.  So yes I would like to go to the mall, or outlet, enter a Gamestop and purchase something for the novelty of being a free range human again.

I think Gamestop is going to have more plays in the future than after today!",1,0

2021-01-30 22:39:29,TheCloth,$GME Weekends Be Like...,"I like the analogy, but something I'm currently not quite clear on is the issue of the shorts not actually having an expiry date. 

Am I right in thinking that the brokers/market makers (I assume) who loaned Melvin and co the shares for the shorts have the right to call in the shorted shares but may choose to let Melvin etc drag it out if they wish?   I'm aware they'll be paying exorbitant interest, but if they're willing to bet that in 2-3 weeks time most retail investors will have given up and sold, meaning the squeeze is off, maybe they'll decide to do that if the cost of waiting out 2-3 weeks of interest is (for example) $1bn, whereas the potential cost of rushing to cover next week in a squeeze would amount to say $3bn?  

Additionally, what's the chance of some sort of dodgy arrangement with the market makers (noting their willingness to help the shorters through Thursday's market manipulation) to ease off on interest or give them more time to unwind their positions cheaply?

Essentially what I'm saying is that when I first got here my (probably incorrect) assumption was that the shorters were fucked because there was an actual deadline that they HAD to cover their shorts and so they would be squeezed then - whereas now I think the situation is more one of attrition and 'hopefully the squeeze happens because they decide they can't wait out any longer', and my concern there is, what if they decide that waiting it out is better than initiating the squeeze.",1,0

Listen up ding dongs, the next few days are extremely important for us to do something and stop prolonging the inevitable. 


Lets get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...

##üöÄüöÄFidelity and VanguardüöÄüöÄ##

You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this. 

##SO MOVE THE FUCK AWAY FROM ROBINHOOD AND MAKE YOURSELF AN ACCOUNT AT EITHER OF THE TWO RELIABLE BROKERS. However do not transfer your portfolio as this can take weeks. Instead use RH to only sell once the squeeze is sqoze  @$4200.69 and beyond.##

TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.

Take these next 2 days by the balls and get yourself a new brokerage. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

If you short a stock at 1$ and it goes down to 0$, you made 1$ profit. But if the stock goes up to 100$, you made 99$ loss.

So the loss potential is potentially infinate and simply has to do with how high the price of the stock gains.

Listen up ding dongs, the next few days are extremely important for us to do something and stop prolonging the inevitable. 


Lets get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...

We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this. 

##SO MOVE THE FUCK AWAY FROM ROBINHOOD AND MAKE YOURSELF AN ACCOUNT AT EITHER OF THE TWO RELIABLE BROKERS. However do not transfer your portfolio as this can take weeks. Instead use RH to only sell once the squeeze is sqoze  @$4200.69 and beyond.##

TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.

After ten green bars you start to worry. ‚ÄúDiamond Hands‚Äù you tell yourself, but your getting anxious. You try not to look at the rising price, and consider locking your phone, but that only makes your stomach ache. The short squeeze accelerates. It‚Äôs been three minutes. Money begins to physically pour out of your phone. Your bathroom floor is covered in a thin layer of $100 bills. You try to shovel it into the tub but it builds up too fast. You lock the bathroom door to prevent the cash from escaping. The air grows thin, rapidly displaced by the impossible flow of cash. The short squeeze accelerates. You slip and fall in the anomalous stream of bills, pouring from your phone. The cash is now six inches deep, and you struggle to put down your phone, but alas, you hands have solidified into perfect diamonds. The short squeeze accelerates. You struggle to stand as the force of the cash rapidly exiting your phone, stuck in your hand and impossible to put down, begins to propel you backwards as if you were on a money printer themed slip-and-slide. Still on your knees, the cash is now at chin height. To avoid drowning you open the bathroom door. The deluge of greenbacks reminds you of the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, only with money instead of molasses. The short squeeze accelerates. It‚Äôs been ten minutes. Your children and wife scream in rapture as their bodies are engulfed by the freshly minted freedom bucks. Your youngest child goes under, with equal parts delight and horror, and muffled cries rising from the churning cash pool. You pray to DeepFuckingValue to finally sell, so you can follow suit. The short squeeze accelerates. You squeeze your eyes shut to stop the eldritch sight of so much money pouring from your phone, but it does not care if you witness it. It can not be contained. The force of the money propels you with such force you feel a sense of weightlessness as you accelerate off the ground. Your body picks up speed as it slides backwards along the uncrumpled bills. You smash through the wall, hurtling into the sky at thirty miles an hour. From a bird‚Äôs eye view you see your house is completely buried in money. Your neighbor calls the SEC. The short squeeze accelerates. As you continue to ascend, you spot police cars racing towards your house. The cops pull out their guns and take aim, but stray bundles of money hit them in the eyes, blinding them. The short squeeze accelerates. You are now at an altitude of 1000 feet. The SWAT team arrives. Military helicopters circle you. The billionaire class has ordered your execution, and hundreds of guns fire on you, yet you remain unharmed, being forged from diamonds. The short squeeze accelerates. It has been two hours. With your ape-like body now entirely composed of Diamond, the money begins to spray as if directed by a rocket nozzle. You break the sound barrier. The government, pressured by WallStreet, deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cash flow sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you leave the Earth. You feel your lungs start to burn, as you reach the edges of the atmosphere. You narrowly miss the ISS, giving it a new green paint job as you fly past. Physicists and economists struggle to calculate your erratic trajectory. The short squeeze accelerates. The money begins to gravitate towards itself, forming a comet trail of cash. Astronomers begin calling you the ‚ÄúGME Rocket.‚Äù You are lost in space, heading roughly in the direction of Andromeda. You wonder, briefly, if perhaps you should hit the Sell button. A small voice in the back of your shattered mind whispers...

We don't hate police, its just they don't really serve our community and write us off like you do, so no point of calling.  The only time anyone ever really calls is to do paperwork since jewelry insurance requires a police report to recoup the loss.  

Having jewelry is okay if you like it.  I guess we can't have any hobbies that deviate from what America deviates as normal.

Still, will these hedge funds have to pay higher interests if they set a new short at, say $500? Might that be their undoing? (From what I understand, the interest rate is based on the underlying stock, not the price at which the short position was initiated, so maybe I'm just a retard. On the other hand, this means that the higher the stock is, the more these hedge funds will bleed by having to pay interest.)",1,0

I come from Hong Kong, and I stand with all WSB people. 

For those people who are fear. Listen! If the short ratio of one stock is talking about over 100%, we must win provided that all retail investors buy and hold. This is simple mathematics. If you give up and sell your stock now, we lose and the hedge fund wins. Don‚Äôt waste the previous effort of bruh here. Strong buy and strong hold.

Please note that it takes at least days or weeks for hedge fund to buy cover the stock. No fear. Bruh! Disregard what the mainstream media and BS said, and simply buy and strong hold GME. YOLO! Keep chasing our dream. Bring GME to moon or even Mars.

If your broker limits buying GME, please don‚Äôt give up and try buying from Sofi and Tradestation. You may contact your account manager of Tradestation for help if you have difficulties of buying GME.

I love you all. Love from Hong Kong.

If my concerns don‚Äôt apply to you, then why are replying? It sounds like you have an inferiority complex where you think things are being directed at you when they aren‚Äôt necessarily being directed at you.

I doubt you'll make enough profit to pay this month's rent, for example. Trading at 325.00 right now, you could buy one stock and the stock price could go up double, or it could collapse completely. Nobody can say for sure, but in my opinion the crash is imminent and any increase in stock value will be nothing compared to the amount it already has increased.

Only buy if you're okay with losing it all. GME is a bubble right now and it's not sustainable. More likely to make a loss at this point than a profit, in my opinion.",1,0

I like the idea of having a thriving online store and here is why.

1.  Freeing up in store space for further product diversification.
2. Free up in store space for live play game space.  Come in, sit down, play D&D.
3. Rise of E-Sports and tapping into that.  Game space for in store tournaments.  People come, watch, play, end up making in store purchases.

Brick and Mortar isn't bad as long as you don't just stop at ""we'll have an online component and that will save us.""

I've seen that fail with SEARS, Lord And Taylor, Nordstrom but they all have one thing in common.  Shitty clothes and bad return policies.  When I worked retail, and everyone should to understand that other people really is Hell, I saw the worst business practices be leading strategies.

One thing in common:  Never updated the stores to match the times.  Each one of them had an old, dirty, a sex crime happened here vibe.  Generally unpleasant.

SEARS:  Junk clothes, junk jewelry, shifted away from real money makers.  Pushing in store credit with high risk customers left a lot of unsecured debt out there.  Poor management and poor customer service.  Liberal as fuck return policy on par with Hecht's which was literally a receiving house for stolen goods at one point.  Sears had a great tool department and auto center but turned most of its locations into knick knack crap stores.  Selling Land's End?  Half the store dedicated to junk clothing line that shares the same sweatshop space as Old Navy.

Lord and Taylor: AKA Hecht's 2.0.  Same shit.  I did doubles working the unloading dock and then sales on the floor.  So they overpaid for poor quality clothing, defective costume jewelry, and compensation for upper management did not reflect the actual work they did.  Middle manager was overworked undersupported.  Upper Manager sipped the corpo kool aid.  Okay so after you unloaded the truck you loaded it up with returns and broken shit that literally fell apart on the rack.  So unsold, unpopular clothing, there was a lot of that, got loaded up as well. It would move on to cheapo retailers, think Marshalls, and failing that boxed up and shipped back to the countries that ironically made the crap for sale there.  The thinking was mitigate losses by selling somewhere.  But all that transporting, time spent packing and unpacking, taking up space and delaying new spring, fall and winter fashions making them outdated when they hit the rack cost them more than just burning it or donating it.

Nordstrom:  Started out high end.  Started replacing high end goods with their product lines.  Shrunk actual high quality clothing and shoes selection.  Nordstrom Rack became the clearing house for crap they couldn't sell.  Men's Suits were incredible if you waited for the ""out of season"" suits to go on sale.  No such thing as an out of season 2 button suit unless its a fucking leisure suit.  Eventually ran itself down trying to cater to bottom dollar customers, which the market is already glutted with that kind of retailer.

How GME is different?  Okay first do you see them pushing high rate store only credit cards?  No.  Do you see them with huge floor space with unmovable product?  No.  Do you see them with a huge floor space and the huge utility bills to match?  No.  Do you see Gamestop with out of control return policies?  No.  

So can Gamestop take it's existing floor space, pivot and reinvent the in store experience?  Yes.  Is Gamestop a distressed stock instead of a distressed company?  Arguably it was a distressed stock, which Cramer himself will tell you is worth buying I've heard him say it.  The above retailers were all distressed companies, that's a no go.  But Wallstreet missed seeing the difference between the stock and company being distressed.

Now for my favorite X Factor of all.  Post COVID life.  Do you think people will flood the malls, bars, entertainment venues, and other spaces after we can all get back outside?  You bet your fucking tendies and rent free basement at mom's house!  Will that need to get out and run free settle down eventually?  Possibly so.  But after nearly 2 years of being trapped indoors the desire to rush out and be anywhere but home is going to hang around for a bit.  So yes I would like to go to the mall, or outlet, enter a Gamestop and purchase something for the novelty of being a free range human again.

I think Gamestop is going to have more plays in the future than after today!",1,0

(Yeah, out there, somewhere, there's other cognitively challenged, educationally subnormal people just like us. Swoon.)

I've set up a GoFundMe for the cause. Every single cent, dime, penny, dollar, euro and pound will be used to purchase GME with all proceeds going to Shelter and St. Mungo's, two amazing UK homeless charities struggling through the pandemic.

Sell limits for the charity donations to be dictated by r/wallstreetbets degen consensus.

I have personal $GME and $AMC bags because my ex-girlfriends' affection-starved ex-boyfriend used to talk about how much he loved the stonk in his sleep. 

I'll keep buying the top, set no limits, and HOLD to infinity. Being economically challenged, I never understood the value of paper anyhow.

Please help me make it go viral by sharing it around. I'll keep the post updated with all developments.

We are the 99.99%. We are the cognitively challenged and educationally subnormal. 

We 'member 2008.

Am I right in thinking that the brokers/market makers (I assume) who loaned Melvin and co the shares for the shorts have the right to call in the shorted shares but may choose to let Melvin etc drag it out if they wish?   I'm aware they'll be paying exorbitant interest, but if they're willing to bet that in 2-3 weeks time most retail investors will have given up and sold, meaning the squeeze is off, maybe they'll decide to do that if the cost of waiting out 2-3 weeks of interest is (for example) $1bn, whereas the potential cost of rushing to cover next week in a squeeze would amount to say $3bn?  

Additionally, what's the chance of some sort of dodgy arrangement with the market makers (noting their willingness to help the shorters through Thursday's market manipulation) to ease off on interest or give them more time to unwind their positions cheaply?

Essentially what I'm saying is that when I first got here my (probably incorrect) assumption was that the shorters were fucked because there was an actual deadline that they HAD to cover their shorts and so they would be squeezed then - whereas now I think the situation is more one of attrition and 'hopefully the squeeze happens because they decide they can't wait out any longer', and my concern there is, what if they decide that waiting it out is better than initiating the squeeze.",1,0

Listen up ding dongs, the next few days are extremely important for us to do something and stop prolonging the inevitable. 


Lets get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...

##üöÄüöÄFidelity and VanguardüöÄüöÄ##

You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this. 

##SO MOVE THE FUCK AWAY FROM ROBINHOOD AND MAKE YOURSELF AN ACCOUNT AT EITHER OF THE TWO RELIABLE BROKERS. However do not transfer your portfolio as this can take weeks. Instead use RH to only sell once the squeeze is sqoze  @$4200.69 and beyond.##

TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.

Take these next 2 days by the balls and get yourself a new brokerage. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

If you short a stock at 1$ and it goes down to 0$, you made 1$ profit. But if the stock goes up to 100$, you made 99$ loss.

So the loss potential is potentially infinate and simply has to do with how high the price of the stock gains.

**Get ready for GME and AMC FUD (Fear Uncertainty Doubt) campaigns on the weekend. It's already starting.**

The number of posts with supposed ""level headed"" advice about how a short squeeze is much more difficult to achieve than we all think, how other stocks are also valuable, and how the strong and powerful hedge funds have much more cards up their sleeve and to ""rethink your strategy"" but still ""Go $GME!! I am one of you guys!"", usually with a few rewards sticked to them, is exploding and will be getting progressively worse in the weekend most certainly.

Does a post sow Fear, or Uncertainty, or Doubt in any way in you? Think for yourself.

Hedge Fund interns have now learned how reddit works and want to part you with your $GME shares.

ALWAYS check the up/downvote ratio and read the comments before getting swayed by whatever semi correct sounding bullshit they're spouting. Oh how desperate they now have become.

So the country club members decide to sell those 20 switches back to melvin for $250. A little more than the $200 they paid, but way less than the town poors are asking. Melvin then delivers 20 switches to the next bunch of country club members in line, and those members do the exact same thing. Melvin obviously takes a bit of a bath on the whole thing, but way less than buying back every switch from the townspeople.

I actually don't know anything about stocks, but i'm trying to think of a way out for melvin in this analogy. Is there a way this could work in the stock market?

Listen up ding dongs, the next few days are extremely important for us to do something and stop prolonging the inevitable. 


Lets get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...

##üöÄüöÄFidelity and VanguardüöÄüöÄ##

You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this. 

##SO MOVE THE FUCK AWAY FROM ROBINHOOD AND MAKE YOURSELF AN ACCOUNT AT EITHER OF THE TWO RELIABLE BROKERS. However do not transfer your portfolio as this can take weeks. Instead use RH to only sell once the squeeze is sqoze  @$4200.69 and beyond.##

TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.

Take these next 2 days by the balls and get yourself a new brokerage. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

But I bought $200 of GME on Tuesday, and bought $300 more yesterday, basically have 3 shares, it's a pittance in the grand scheme of things, but it's everything I could afford, it's a lot of money to me and my family, but fuck it, I'm holding on, if I lose it I lose it. I watched on Thursday where I ""lost"" about $700 when it crashed down to $120ish, this is about more than money now.

After ten green bars you start to worry. ‚ÄúDiamond Hands‚Äù you tell yourself, but your getting anxious. You try not to look at the rising price, and consider locking your phone, but that only makes your stomach ache. The short squeeze accelerates. It‚Äôs been three minutes. Money begins to physically pour out of your phone. Your bathroom floor is covered in a thin layer of $100 bills. You try to shovel it into the tub but it builds up too fast. You lock the bathroom door to prevent the cash from escaping. The air grows thin, rapidly displaced by the impossible flow of cash. The short squeeze accelerates. You slip and fall in the anomalous stream of bills, pouring from your phone. The cash is now six inches deep, and you struggle to put down your phone, but alas, you hands have solidified into perfect diamonds. The short squeeze accelerates. You struggle to stand as the force of the cash rapidly exiting your phone, stuck in your hand and impossible to put down, begins to propel you backwards as if you were on a money printer themed slip-and-slide. Still on your knees, the cash is now at chin height. To avoid drowning you open the bathroom door. The deluge of greenbacks reminds you of the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, only with money instead of molasses. The short squeeze accelerates. It‚Äôs been ten minutes. Your children and wife scream in rapture as their bodies are engulfed by the freshly minted freedom bucks. Your youngest child goes under, with equal parts delight and horror, and muffled cries rising from the churning cash pool. You pray to DeepFuckingValue to finally sell, so you can follow suit. The short squeeze accelerates. You squeeze your eyes shut to stop the eldritch sight of so much money pouring from your phone, but it does not care if you witness it. It can not be contained. The force of the money propels you with such force you feel a sense of weightlessness as you accelerate off the ground. Your body picks up speed as it slides backwards along the uncrumpled bills. You smash through the wall, hurtling into the sky at thirty miles an hour. From a bird‚Äôs eye view you see your house is completely buried in money. Your neighbor calls the SEC. The short squeeze accelerates. As you continue to ascend, you spot police cars racing towards your house. The cops pull out their guns and take aim, but stray bundles of money hit them in the eyes, blinding them. The short squeeze accelerates. You are now at an altitude of 1000 feet. The SWAT team arrives. Military helicopters circle you. The billionaire class has ordered your execution, and hundreds of guns fire on you, yet you remain unharmed, being forged from diamonds. The short squeeze accelerates. It has been two hours. With your ape-like body now entirely composed of Diamond, the money begins to spray as if directed by a rocket nozzle. You break the sound barrier. The government, pressured by WallStreet, deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cash flow sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you leave the Earth. You feel your lungs start to burn, as you reach the edges of the atmosphere. You narrowly miss the ISS, giving it a new green paint job as you fly past. Physicists and economists struggle to calculate your erratic trajectory. The short squeeze accelerates. The money begins to gravitate towards itself, forming a comet trail of cash. Astronomers begin calling you the ‚ÄúGME Rocket.‚Äù You are lost in space, heading roughly in the direction of Andromeda. You wonder, briefly, if perhaps you should hit the Sell button. A small voice in the back of your shattered mind whispers...

For those people who are fear. Listen! If the short ratio of one stock is talking about over 100%, we must win provided that all retail investors buy and hold. This is simple mathematics. If you give up and sell your stock now, we lose and the hedge fund wins. Don‚Äôt waste the previous effort of bruh here. Strong buy and strong hold.

Please note that it takes at least days or weeks for hedge fund to buy cover the stock. No fear. Bruh! Disregard what the mainstream media and BS said, and simply buy and strong hold GME. YOLO! Keep chasing our dream. Bring GME to moon or even Mars.

If your broker limits buying GME, please don‚Äôt give up and try buying from Sofi and Tradestation. You may contact your account manager of Tradestation for help if you have difficulties of buying GME.

What condescension and hand wringing are you imagining here? You‚Äôre showing just how delusional you are seeing things that aren‚Äôt actually there. If my concerns don‚Äôt apply to you, then why are replying? It sounds like you have an inferiority complex where you think things are being directed at you when they aren‚Äôt necessarily being directed at you. Or you see someone who came from nothing and made millions on his own and you realize that you‚Äôre wasting your life or something. But I didn‚Äôt do anything to you. I haven‚Äôt oppressed you or anyone ever. So please snap out of your delusional fantasies and at least with me, see what is actually happening in this particular conversation. Whatever delusions you have about GameStop is another issue.

RH immediately gives them 5k to spend pending the ACH transfer.

I like the idea of having a thriving online store and here is why.

1.  Freeing up in store space for further product diversification.
2. Free up in store space for live play game space.  Come in, sit down, play D&D.
3. Rise of E-Sports and tapping into that.  Game space for in store tournaments.  People come, watch, play, end up making in store purchases.

Brick and Mortar isn't bad as long as you don't just stop at ""we'll have an online component and that will save us.""

I've seen that fail with SEARS, Lord And Taylor, Nordstrom but they all have one thing in common.  Shitty clothes and bad return policies.  When I worked retail, and everyone should to understand that other people really is Hell, I saw the worst business practices be leading strategies.

One thing in common:  Never updated the stores to match the times.  Each one of them had an old, dirty, a sex crime happened here vibe.  Generally unpleasant.

SEARS:  Junk clothes, junk jewelry, shifted away from real money makers.  Pushing in store credit with high risk customers left a lot of unsecured debt out there.  Poor management and poor customer service.  Liberal as fuck return policy on par with Hecht's which was literally a receiving house for stolen goods at one point.  Sears had a great tool department and auto center but turned most of its locations into knick knack crap stores.  Selling Land's End?  Half the store dedicated to junk clothing line that shares the same sweatshop space as Old Navy.

Lord and Taylor: AKA Hecht's 2.0.  Same shit.  I did doubles working the unloading dock and then sales on the floor.  So they overpaid for poor quality clothing, defective costume jewelry, and compensation for upper management did not reflect the actual work they did.  Middle manager was overworked undersupported.  Upper Manager sipped the corpo kool aid.  Okay so after you unloaded the truck you loaded it up with returns and broken shit that literally fell apart on the rack.  So unsold, unpopular clothing, there was a lot of that, got loaded up as well. It would move on to cheapo retailers, think Marshalls, and failing that boxed up and shipped back to the countries that ironically made the crap for sale there.  The thinking was mitigate losses by selling somewhere.  But all that transporting, time spent packing and unpacking, taking up space and delaying new spring, fall and winter fashions making them outdated when they hit the rack cost them more than just burning it or donating it.

Nordstrom:  Started out high end.  Started replacing high end goods with their product lines.  Shrunk actual high quality clothing and shoes selection.  Nordstrom Rack became the clearing house for crap they couldn't sell.  Men's Suits were incredible if you waited for the ""out of season"" suits to go on sale.  No such thing as an out of season 2 button suit unless its a fucking leisure suit.  Eventually ran itself down trying to cater to bottom dollar customers, which the market is already glutted with that kind of retailer.

How GME is different?  Okay first do you see them pushing high rate store only credit cards?  No.  Do you see them with huge floor space with unmovable product?  No.  Do you see them with a huge floor space and the huge utility bills to match?  No.  Do you see Gamestop with out of control return policies?  No.  

So can Gamestop take it's existing floor space, pivot and reinvent the in store experience?  Yes.  Is Gamestop a distressed stock instead of a distressed company?  Arguably it was a distressed stock, which Cramer himself will tell you is worth buying I've heard him say it.  The above retailers were all distressed companies, that's a no go.  But Wallstreet missed seeing the difference between the stock and company being distressed.

Now for my favorite X Factor of all.  Post COVID life.  Do you think people will flood the malls, bars, entertainment venues, and other spaces after we can all get back outside?  You bet your fucking tendies and rent free basement at mom's house!  Will that need to get out and run free settle down eventually?  Possibly so.  But after nearly 2 years of being trapped indoors the desire to rush out and be anywhere but home is going to hang around for a bit.  So yes I would like to go to the mall, or outlet, enter a Gamestop and purchase something for the novelty of being a free range human again.

I think Gamestop is going to have more plays in the future than after today!",1,0

2021-01-30 22:39:29,TheCloth,News reporters looking at WSB and all they see is memes but stonks keep going up.,"I like the analogy, but something I'm currently not quite clear on is the issue of the shorts not actually having an expiry date. 

Am I right in thinking that the brokers/market makers (I assume) who loaned Melvin and co the shares for the shorts have the right to call in the shorted shares but may choose to let Melvin etc drag it out if they wish?   I'm aware they'll be paying exorbitant interest, but if they're willing to bet that in 2-3 weeks time most retail investors will have given up and sold, meaning the squeeze is off, maybe they'll decide to do that if the cost of waiting out 2-3 weeks of interest is (for example) $1bn, whereas the potential cost of rushing to cover next week in a squeeze would amount to say $3bn?  

Additionally, what's the chance of some sort of dodgy arrangement with the market makers (noting their willingness to help the shorters through Thursday's market manipulation) to ease off on interest or give them more time to unwind their positions cheaply?

Essentially what I'm saying is that when I first got here my (probably incorrect) assumption was that the shorters were fucked because there was an actual deadline that they HAD to cover their shorts and so they would be squeezed then - whereas now I think the situation is more one of attrition and 'hopefully the squeeze happens because they decide they can't wait out any longer', and my concern there is, what if they decide that waiting it out is better than initiating the squeeze.",1,0

Listen up ding dongs, the next few days are extremely important for us to do something and stop prolonging the inevitable. 


Lets get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...

##üöÄüöÄFidelity and VanguardüöÄüöÄ##

You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this. 

##SO MOVE THE FUCK AWAY FROM ROBINHOOD AND MAKE YOURSELF AN ACCOUNT AT EITHER OF THE TWO RELIABLE BROKERS. However do not transfer your portfolio as this can take weeks. Instead use RH to only sell once the squeeze is sqoze  @$4200.69 and beyond.##

TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.

Take these next 2 days by the balls and get yourself a new brokerage. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

If you short a stock at 1$ and it goes down to 0$, you made 1$ profit. But if the stock goes up to 100$, you made 99$ loss.

So the loss potential is potentially infinate and simply has to do with how high the price of the stock gains.

**Get ready for GME and AMC FUD (Fear Uncertainty Doubt) campaigns on the weekend. It's already starting.**

The number of posts with supposed ""level headed"" advice about how a short squeeze is much more difficult to achieve than we all think, how other stocks are also valuable, and how the strong and powerful hedge funds have much more cards up their sleeve and to ""rethink your strategy"" but still ""Go $GME!! I am one of you guys!"", usually with a few rewards sticked to them, is exploding and will be getting progressively worse in the weekend most certainly.

Does a post sow Fear, or Uncertainty, or Doubt in any way in you? Think for yourself.

Hedge Fund interns have now learned how reddit works and want to part you with your $GME shares.

ALWAYS check the up/downvote ratio and read the comments before getting swayed by whatever semi correct sounding bullshit they're spouting. Oh how desperate they now have become.

So when melvin collects 20 switches at inflated prices, he delivers the first 20 owed to the country club members.

So the country club members decide to sell those 20 switches back to melvin for $250. A little more than the $200 they paid, but way less than the town poors are asking. Melvin then delivers 20 switches to the next bunch of country club members in line, and those members do the exact same thing. Melvin obviously takes a bit of a bath on the whole thing, but way less than buying back every switch from the townspeople.

I actually don't know anything about stocks, but i'm trying to think of a way out for melvin in this analogy. Is there a way this could work in the stock market?

Listen up ding dongs, the next few days are extremely important for us to do something and stop prolonging the inevitable. 


Lets get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...

##üöÄüöÄFidelity and VanguardüöÄüöÄ##

You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this. 

##SO MOVE THE FUCK AWAY FROM ROBINHOOD AND MAKE YOURSELF AN ACCOUNT AT EITHER OF THE TWO RELIABLE BROKERS. However do not transfer your portfolio as this can take weeks. Instead use RH to only sell once the squeeze is sqoze  @$4200.69 and beyond.##

TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.

Take these next 2 days by the balls and get yourself a new brokerage. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

But I bought $200 of GME on Tuesday, and bought $300 more yesterday, basically have 3 shares, it's a pittance in the grand scheme of things, but it's everything I could afford, it's a lot of money to me and my family, but fuck it, I'm holding on, if I lose it I lose it. I watched on Thursday where I ""lost"" about $700 when it crashed down to $120ish, this is about more than money now.

You sit on the toilet and check Robinhood, when you notice GME squeezing uncontrollably. After ten green bars you start to worry. ‚ÄúDiamond Hands‚Äù you tell yourself, but your getting anxious. You try not to look at the rising price, and consider locking your phone, but that only makes your stomach ache. The short squeeze accelerates. It‚Äôs been three minutes. Money begins to physically pour out of your phone. Your bathroom floor is covered in a thin layer of $100 bills. You try to shovel it into the tub but it builds up too fast. You lock the bathroom door to prevent the cash from escaping. The air grows thin, rapidly displaced by the impossible flow of cash. The short squeeze accelerates. You slip and fall in the anomalous stream of bills, pouring from your phone. The cash is now six inches deep, and you struggle to put down your phone, but alas, you hands have solidified into perfect diamonds. The short squeeze accelerates. You struggle to stand as the force of the cash rapidly exiting your phone, stuck in your hand and impossible to put down, begins to propel you backwards as if you were on a money printer themed slip-and-slide. Still on your knees, the cash is now at chin height. To avoid drowning you open the bathroom door. The deluge of greenbacks reminds you of the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, only with money instead of molasses. The short squeeze accelerates. It‚Äôs been ten minutes. Your children and wife scream in rapture as their bodies are engulfed by the freshly minted freedom bucks. Your youngest child goes under, with equal parts delight and horror, and muffled cries rising from the churning cash pool. You pray to DeepFuckingValue to finally sell, so you can follow suit. The short squeeze accelerates. You squeeze your eyes shut to stop the eldritch sight of so much money pouring from your phone, but it does not care if you witness it. It can not be contained. The force of the money propels you with such force you feel a sense of weightlessness as you accelerate off the ground. Your body picks up speed as it slides backwards along the uncrumpled bills. You smash through the wall, hurtling into the sky at thirty miles an hour. From a bird‚Äôs eye view you see your house is completely buried in money. Your neighbor calls the SEC. The short squeeze accelerates. As you continue to ascend, you spot police cars racing towards your house. The cops pull out their guns and take aim, but stray bundles of money hit them in the eyes, blinding them. The short squeeze accelerates. You are now at an altitude of 1000 feet. The SWAT team arrives. Military helicopters circle you. The billionaire class has ordered your execution, and hundreds of guns fire on you, yet you remain unharmed, being forged from diamonds. The short squeeze accelerates. It has been two hours. With your ape-like body now entirely composed of Diamond, the money begins to spray as if directed by a rocket nozzle. You break the sound barrier. The government, pressured by WallStreet, deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cash flow sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you leave the Earth. You feel your lungs start to burn, as you reach the edges of the atmosphere. You narrowly miss the ISS, giving it a new green paint job as you fly past. Physicists and economists struggle to calculate your erratic trajectory. The short squeeze accelerates. The money begins to gravitate towards itself, forming a comet trail of cash. Astronomers begin calling you the ‚ÄúGME Rocket.‚Äù You are lost in space, heading roughly in the direction of Andromeda. You wonder, briefly, if perhaps you should hit the Sell button. A small voice in the back of your shattered mind whispers...

If you give up and sell your stock now, we lose and the hedge fund wins. Don‚Äôt waste the previous effort of bruh here. Strong buy and strong hold.

Please note that it takes at least days or weeks for hedge fund to buy cover the stock. No fear. Bruh! Disregard what the mainstream media and BS said, and simply buy and strong hold GME. YOLO! Keep chasing our dream. Bring GME to moon or even Mars.

What condescension and hand wringing are you imagining here? You‚Äôre showing just how delusional you are seeing things that aren‚Äôt actually there. If my concerns don‚Äôt apply to you, then why are replying? It sounds like you have an inferiority complex where you think things are being directed at you when they aren‚Äôt necessarily being directed at you. Or you see someone who came from nothing and made millions on his own and you realize that you‚Äôre wasting your life or something. But I didn‚Äôt do anything to you. I haven‚Äôt oppressed you or anyone ever. So please snap out of your delusional fantasies and at least with me, see what is actually happening in this particular conversation. Whatever delusions you have about GameStop is another issue.

Investors with smaller baskets must wait until their redemption orders are combined with others to reach the 50,000 unit minimum"".

She funded the account on creation with 5K.

RH immediately gives them 5k to spend pending the ACH transfer. 

If the ACH fails (bounces) because of NSF in the bank account, then RH will have whatever rights they give themselves from the contract.

However, in that case OP should have all 5k in their bank.

I doubt you'll make enough profit to pay this month's rent, for example. Trading at 325.00 right now, you could buy one stock and the stock price could go up double, or it could collapse completely. Nobody can say for sure, but in my opinion the crash is imminent and any increase in stock value will be nothing compared to the amount it already has increased.

I like the idea of having a thriving online store and here is why.

1.  Freeing up in store space for further product diversification.
2. Free up in store space for live play game space.  Come in, sit down, play D&D.
3. Rise of E-Sports and tapping into that.  Game space for in store tournaments.  People come, watch, play, end up making in store purchases.

Brick and Mortar isn't bad as long as you don't just stop at ""we'll have an online component and that will save us.""

I've seen that fail with SEARS, Lord And Taylor, Nordstrom but they all have one thing in common.  Shitty clothes and bad return policies.  When I worked retail, and everyone should to understand that other people really is Hell, I saw the worst business practices be leading strategies.

One thing in common:  Never updated the stores to match the times.  Each one of them had an old, dirty, a sex crime happened here vibe.  Generally unpleasant.

SEARS:  Junk clothes, junk jewelry, shifted away from real money makers.  Pushing in store credit with high risk customers left a lot of unsecured debt out there.  Poor management and poor customer service.  Liberal as fuck return policy on par with Hecht's which was literally a receiving house for stolen goods at one point.  Sears had a great tool department and auto center but turned most of its locations into knick knack crap stores.  Selling Land's End?  Half the store dedicated to junk clothing line that shares the same sweatshop space as Old Navy.

Lord and Taylor: AKA Hecht's 2.0.  Same shit.  I did doubles working the unloading dock and then sales on the floor.  So they overpaid for poor quality clothing, defective costume jewelry, and compensation for upper management did not reflect the actual work they did.  Middle manager was overworked undersupported.  Upper Manager sipped the corpo kool aid.  Okay so after you unloaded the truck you loaded it up with returns and broken shit that literally fell apart on the rack.  So unsold, unpopular clothing, there was a lot of that, got loaded up as well. It would move on to cheapo retailers, think Marshalls, and failing that boxed up and shipped back to the countries that ironically made the crap for sale there.  The thinking was mitigate losses by selling somewhere.  But all that transporting, time spent packing and unpacking, taking up space and delaying new spring, fall and winter fashions making them outdated when they hit the rack cost them more than just burning it or donating it.

Nordstrom:  Started out high end.  Started replacing high end goods with their product lines.  Shrunk actual high quality clothing and shoes selection.  Nordstrom Rack became the clearing house for crap they couldn't sell.  Men's Suits were incredible if you waited for the ""out of season"" suits to go on sale.  No such thing as an out of season 2 button suit unless its a fucking leisure suit.  Eventually ran itself down trying to cater to bottom dollar customers, which the market is already glutted with that kind of retailer.

How GME is different?  Okay first do you see them pushing high rate store only credit cards?  No.  Do you see them with huge floor space with unmovable product?  No.  Do you see them with a huge floor space and the huge utility bills to match?  No.  Do you see Gamestop with out of control return policies?  No.  

So can Gamestop take it's existing floor space, pivot and reinvent the in store experience?  Yes.  Is Gamestop a distressed stock instead of a distressed company?  Arguably it was a distressed stock, which Cramer himself will tell you is worth buying I've heard him say it.  The above retailers were all distressed companies, that's a no go.  But Wallstreet missed seeing the difference between the stock and company being distressed.

Now for my favorite X Factor of all.  Post COVID life.  Do you think people will flood the malls, bars, entertainment venues, and other spaces after we can all get back outside?  You bet your fucking tendies and rent free basement at mom's house!  Will that need to get out and run free settle down eventually?  Possibly so.  But after nearly 2 years of being trapped indoors the desire to rush out and be anywhere but home is going to hang around for a bit.  So yes I would like to go to the mall, or outlet, enter a Gamestop and purchase something for the novelty of being a free range human again.

I think Gamestop is going to have more plays in the future than after today!",1,0

2021-01-30 22:39:29,TheCloth,"Down over $1 Million on Thursday, back on track yesterday. I'm not fucking selling üöÄüöÄüöÄ","I like the analogy, but something I'm currently not quite clear on is the issue of the shorts not actually having an expiry date. 

Am I right in thinking that the brokers/market makers (I assume) who loaned Melvin and co the shares for the shorts have the right to call in the shorted shares but may choose to let Melvin etc drag it out if they wish?   I'm aware they'll be paying exorbitant interest, but if they're willing to bet that in 2-3 weeks time most retail investors will have given up and sold, meaning the squeeze is off, maybe they'll decide to do that if the cost of waiting out 2-3 weeks of interest is (for example) $1bn, whereas the potential cost of rushing to cover next week in a squeeze would amount to say $3bn?  

Additionally, what's the chance of some sort of dodgy arrangement with the market makers (noting their willingness to help the shorters through Thursday's market manipulation) to ease off on interest or give them more time to unwind their positions cheaply?

Essentially what I'm saying is that when I first got here my (probably incorrect) assumption was that the shorters were fucked because there was an actual deadline that they HAD to cover their shorts and so they would be squeezed then - whereas now I think the situation is more one of attrition and 'hopefully the squeeze happens because they decide they can't wait out any longer', and my concern there is, what if they decide that waiting it out is better than initiating the squeeze.",1,0

Listen up ding dongs, the next few days are extremely important for us to do something and stop prolonging the inevitable. 


Lets get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...

##üöÄüöÄFidelity and VanguardüöÄüöÄ##

You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this. 

##SO MOVE THE FUCK AWAY FROM ROBINHOOD AND MAKE YOURSELF AN ACCOUNT AT EITHER OF THE TWO RELIABLE BROKERS. However do not transfer your portfolio as this can take weeks. Instead use RH to only sell once the squeeze is sqoze  @$4200.69 and beyond.##

TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.

Take these next 2 days by the balls and get yourself a new brokerage. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

If you short a stock at 1$ and it goes down to 0$, you made 1$ profit. But if the stock goes up to 100$, you made 99$ loss.

So the loss potential is potentially infinate and simply has to do with how high the price of the stock gains.

**Get ready for GME and AMC FUD (Fear Uncertainty Doubt) campaigns on the weekend. It's already starting.**

The number of posts with supposed ""level headed"" advice about how a short squeeze is much more difficult to achieve than we all think, how other stocks are also valuable, and how the strong and powerful hedge funds have much more cards up their sleeve and to ""rethink your strategy"" but still ""Go $GME!! I am one of you guys!"", usually with a few rewards sticked to them, is exploding and will be getting progressively worse in the weekend most certainly.

Does a post sow Fear, or Uncertainty, or Doubt in any way in you? Think for yourself.

Hedge Fund interns have now learned how reddit works and want to part you with your $GME shares.

ALWAYS check the up/downvote ratio and read the comments before getting swayed by whatever semi correct sounding bullshit they're spouting. Oh how desperate they now have become.

So when melvin collects 20 switches at inflated prices, he delivers the first 20 owed to the country club members.

So the country club members decide to sell those 20 switches back to melvin for $250. A little more than the $200 they paid, but way less than the town poors are asking. Melvin then delivers 20 switches to the next bunch of country club members in line, and those members do the exact same thing. Melvin obviously takes a bit of a bath on the whole thing, but way less than buying back every switch from the townspeople.

I actually don't know anything about stocks, but i'm trying to think of a way out for melvin in this analogy. Is there a way this could work in the stock market?

Listen up ding dongs, the next few days are extremely important for us to do something and stop prolonging the inevitable. 


Lets get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...

##üöÄüöÄFidelity and VanguardüöÄüöÄ##

You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this. 

##SO MOVE THE FUCK AWAY FROM ROBINHOOD AND MAKE YOURSELF AN ACCOUNT AT EITHER OF THE TWO RELIABLE BROKERS. However do not transfer your portfolio as this can take weeks. Instead use RH to only sell once the squeeze is sqoze  @$4200.69 and beyond.##

TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.

Take these next 2 days by the balls and get yourself a new brokerage. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Don't be toxic. And there are plenty of short squeeze opportunities out there. GME is getting to big for some 1 stock noobs to reach so we need to accept that the current movement is bigger than GME. AMC is not a threat to GME.

You sit on the toilet and check Robinhood, when you notice GME squeezing uncontrollably. After ten green bars you start to worry. ‚ÄúDiamond Hands‚Äù you tell yourself, but your getting anxious. You try not to look at the rising price, and consider locking your phone, but that only makes your stomach ache. The short squeeze accelerates. It‚Äôs been three minutes. Money begins to physically pour out of your phone. Your bathroom floor is covered in a thin layer of $100 bills. You try to shovel it into the tub but it builds up too fast. You lock the bathroom door to prevent the cash from escaping. The air grows thin, rapidly displaced by the impossible flow of cash. The short squeeze accelerates. You slip and fall in the anomalous stream of bills, pouring from your phone. The cash is now six inches deep, and you struggle to put down your phone, but alas, you hands have solidified into perfect diamonds. The short squeeze accelerates. You struggle to stand as the force of the cash rapidly exiting your phone, stuck in your hand and impossible to put down, begins to propel you backwards as if you were on a money printer themed slip-and-slide. Still on your knees, the cash is now at chin height. To avoid drowning you open the bathroom door. The deluge of greenbacks reminds you of the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, only with money instead of molasses. The short squeeze accelerates. It‚Äôs been ten minutes. Your children and wife scream in rapture as their bodies are engulfed by the freshly minted freedom bucks. Your youngest child goes under, with equal parts delight and horror, and muffled cries rising from the churning cash pool. You pray to DeepFuckingValue to finally sell, so you can follow suit. The short squeeze accelerates. You squeeze your eyes shut to stop the eldritch sight of so much money pouring from your phone, but it does not care if you witness it. It can not be contained. The force of the money propels you with such force you feel a sense of weightlessness as you accelerate off the ground. Your body picks up speed as it slides backwards along the uncrumpled bills. You smash through the wall, hurtling into the sky at thirty miles an hour. From a bird‚Äôs eye view you see your house is completely buried in money. Your neighbor calls the SEC. The short squeeze accelerates. As you continue to ascend, you spot police cars racing towards your house. The cops pull out their guns and take aim, but stray bundles of money hit them in the eyes, blinding them. The short squeeze accelerates. You are now at an altitude of 1000 feet. The SWAT team arrives. Military helicopters circle you. The billionaire class has ordered your execution, and hundreds of guns fire on you, yet you remain unharmed, being forged from diamonds. The short squeeze accelerates. It has been two hours. With your ape-like body now entirely composed of Diamond, the money begins to spray as if directed by a rocket nozzle. You break the sound barrier. The government, pressured by WallStreet, deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cash flow sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you leave the Earth. You feel your lungs start to burn, as you reach the edges of the atmosphere. You narrowly miss the ISS, giving it a new green paint job as you fly past. Physicists and economists struggle to calculate your erratic trajectory. The short squeeze accelerates. The money begins to gravitate towards itself, forming a comet trail of cash. Astronomers begin calling you the ‚ÄúGME Rocket.‚Äù You are lost in space, heading roughly in the direction of Andromeda. You wonder, briefly, if perhaps you should hit the Sell button. A small voice in the back of your shattered mind whispers...

She funded the account on creation with 5K.

RH immediately gives them 5k to spend pending the ACH transfer. 

If the ACH fails (bounces) because of NSF in the bank account, then RH will have whatever rights they give themselves from the contract.

However, in that case OP should have all 5k in their bank.

I like the idea of having a thriving online store and here is why.

1.  Freeing up in store space for further product diversification.
2. Free up in store space for live play game space.  Come in, sit down, play D&D.
3. Rise of E-Sports and tapping into that.  Game space for in store tournaments.  People come, watch, play, end up making in store purchases.

Brick and Mortar isn't bad as long as you don't just stop at ""we'll have an online component and that will save us.""

I've seen that fail with SEARS, Lord And Taylor, Nordstrom but they all have one thing in common.  Shitty clothes and bad return policies.  When I worked retail, and everyone should to understand that other people really is Hell, I saw the worst business practices be leading strategies.

One thing in common:  Never updated the stores to match the times.  Each one of them had an old, dirty, a sex crime happened here vibe.  Generally unpleasant.

SEARS:  Junk clothes, junk jewelry, shifted away from real money makers.  Pushing in store credit with high risk customers left a lot of unsecured debt out there.  Poor management and poor customer service.  Liberal as fuck return policy on par with Hecht's which was literally a receiving house for stolen goods at one point.  Sears had a great tool department and auto center but turned most of its locations into knick knack crap stores.  Selling Land's End?  Half the store dedicated to junk clothing line that shares the same sweatshop space as Old Navy.

Lord and Taylor: AKA Hecht's 2.0.  Same shit.  I did doubles working the unloading dock and then sales on the floor.  So they overpaid for poor quality clothing, defective costume jewelry, and compensation for upper management did not reflect the actual work they did.  Middle manager was overworked undersupported.  Upper Manager sipped the corpo kool aid.  Okay so after you unloaded the truck you loaded it up with returns and broken shit that literally fell apart on the rack.  So unsold, unpopular clothing, there was a lot of that, got loaded up as well. It would move on to cheapo retailers, think Marshalls, and failing that boxed up and shipped back to the countries that ironically made the crap for sale there.  The thinking was mitigate losses by selling somewhere.  But all that transporting, time spent packing and unpacking, taking up space and delaying new spring, fall and winter fashions making them outdated when they hit the rack cost them more than just burning it or donating it.

Nordstrom:  Started out high end.  Started replacing high end goods with their product lines.  Shrunk actual high quality clothing and shoes selection.  Nordstrom Rack became the clearing house for crap they couldn't sell.  Men's Suits were incredible if you waited for the ""out of season"" suits to go on sale.  No such thing as an out of season 2 button suit unless its a fucking leisure suit.  Eventually ran itself down trying to cater to bottom dollar customers, which the market is already glutted with that kind of retailer.

How GME is different?  Okay first do you see them pushing high rate store only credit cards?  No.  Do you see them with huge floor space with unmovable product?  No.  Do you see them with a huge floor space and the huge utility bills to match?  No.  Do you see Gamestop with out of control return policies?  No.  

So can Gamestop take it's existing floor space, pivot and reinvent the in store experience?  Yes.  Is Gamestop a distressed stock instead of a distressed company?  Arguably it was a distressed stock, which Cramer himself will tell you is worth buying I've heard him say it.  The above retailers were all distressed companies, that's a no go.  But Wallstreet missed seeing the difference between the stock and company being distressed.

Now for my favorite X Factor of all.  Post COVID life.  Do you think people will flood the malls, bars, entertainment venues, and other spaces after we can all get back outside?  You bet your fucking tendies and rent free basement at mom's house!  Will that need to get out and run free settle down eventually?  Possibly so.  But after nearly 2 years of being trapped indoors the desire to rush out and be anywhere but home is going to hang around for a bit.  So yes I would like to go to the mall, or outlet, enter a Gamestop and purchase something for the novelty of being a free range human again.

I think Gamestop is going to have more plays in the future than after today!",1,0

(Yeah, out there, somewhere, there's other cognitively challenged, educationally subnormal people just like us. Swoon.)

I've set up a GoFundMe for the cause. Every single cent, dime, penny, dollar, euro and pound will be used to purchase GME with all proceeds going to Shelter and St. Mungo's, two amazing UK homeless charities struggling through the pandemic.

Sell limits for the charity donations to be dictated by r/wallstreetbets degen consensus.

I have personal $GME and $AMC bags because my ex-girlfriends' affection-starved ex-boyfriend used to talk about how much he loved the stonk in his sleep. 

I'll keep buying the top, set no limits, and HOLD to infinity. Being economically challenged, I never understood the value of paper anyhow.

Please help me make it go viral by sharing it around. I'll keep the post updated with all developments.

Am I right in thinking that the brokers/market makers (I assume) who loaned Melvin and co the shares for the shorts have the right to call in the shorted shares but may choose to let Melvin etc drag it out if they wish?   I'm aware they'll be paying exorbitant interest, but if they're willing to bet that in 2-3 weeks time most retail investors will have given up and sold, meaning the squeeze is off, maybe they'll decide to do that if the cost of waiting out 2-3 weeks of interest is (for example) $1bn, whereas the potential cost of rushing to cover next week in a squeeze would amount to say $3bn?  

Additionally, what's the chance of some sort of dodgy arrangement with the market makers (noting their willingness to help the shorters through Thursday's market manipulation) to ease off on interest or give them more time to unwind their positions cheaply?

Essentially what I'm saying is that when I first got here my (probably incorrect) assumption was that the shorters were fucked because there was an actual deadline that they HAD to cover their shorts and so they would be squeezed then - whereas now I think the situation is more one of attrition and 'hopefully the squeeze happens because they decide they can't wait out any longer', and my concern there is, what if they decide that waiting it out is better than initiating the squeeze.",1,0

Listen up ding dongs, the next few days are extremely important for us to do something and stop prolonging the inevitable. 


Lets get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...

##üöÄüöÄFidelity and VanguardüöÄüöÄ##

You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this. 

##SO MOVE THE FUCK AWAY FROM ROBINHOOD AND MAKE YOURSELF AN ACCOUNT AT EITHER OF THE TWO RELIABLE BROKERS. However do not transfer your portfolio as this can take weeks. Instead use RH to only sell once the squeeze is sqoze  @$4200.69 and beyond.##

TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.

Take these next 2 days by the balls and get yourself a new brokerage. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

If you short a stock at 1$ and it goes down to 0$, you made 1$ profit. But if the stock goes up to 100$, you made 99$ loss.

So the loss potential is potentially infinate and simply has to do with how high the price of the stock gains.

**Get ready for GME and AMC FUD (Fear Uncertainty Doubt) campaigns on the weekend. It's already starting.**

The number of posts with supposed ""level headed"" advice about how a short squeeze is much more difficult to achieve than we all think, how other stocks are also valuable, and how the strong and powerful hedge funds have much more cards up their sleeve and to ""rethink your strategy"" but still ""Go $GME!! I am one of you guys!"", usually with a few rewards sticked to them, is exploding and will be getting progressively worse in the weekend most certainly.

Does a post sow Fear, or Uncertainty, or Doubt in any way in you? Think for yourself.

Hedge Fund interns have now learned how reddit works and want to part you with your $GME shares.

ALWAYS check the up/downvote ratio and read the comments before getting swayed by whatever semi correct sounding bullshit they're spouting. Oh how desperate they now have become.

Melvin then delivers 20 switches to the next bunch of country club members in line, and those members do the exact same thing. Melvin obviously takes a bit of a bath on the whole thing, but way less than buying back every switch from the townspeople.

Listen up ding dongs, the next few days are extremely important for us to do something and stop prolonging the inevitable. 


Lets get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...

##üöÄüöÄFidelity and VanguardüöÄüöÄ##

You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this. 

##SO MOVE THE FUCK AWAY FROM ROBINHOOD AND MAKE YOURSELF AN ACCOUNT AT EITHER OF THE TWO RELIABLE BROKERS. However do not transfer your portfolio as this can take weeks. Instead use RH to only sell once the squeeze is sqoze  @$4200.69 and beyond.##

TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.

Take these next 2 days by the balls and get yourself a new brokerage. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

You don‚Äôt respect us and u got caught with ur pants down. We have done nothing but actually read the rules and played by them. By ur rules!!! 

So even though they are trying to shut it down it‚Äôs more important than ever that even if it‚Äôs one share u buy the stock u like because U LIKE IT!!! 
Fuck the institution that thinks they can treat us like inferiors the whole world is rising up!!!

For that entire time  people have been lamenting the good old days. Back then when a post got over 600 upvotes it was eye popping. 

The tone of Reddit has actually never changed, and I don‚Äôt foresee that happening any time soon. 

I did take a break for a few years and have been back on this last year and the thing that has changed is the awards and advertisements. I like the awards, it‚Äôs like giving a huge upvote which I always wished I could do. The advertisements I could obviously do without. But they do need to keep the site running. Other than that the tone of the comments have never changed, including remembering the good old days.",1,0

SLV trusts is subsidiary of Blackrock and I somehow cannot trust the hedge funds who got us into so much trouble in the past. The redemption clauses are not very clear too i.e. they say ""Each unit represents one ounce of silver. Units are redeemable for physical silver in minimum basket sizes of 50,000 units. Investors with smaller baskets must wait until their redemption orders are combined with others to reach the 50,000 unit minimum"". I find Perthmint and BullionVault more trustworthy as they are purely into metals. I am not sure about demarkations between SLV and Blackrock. Happy to be educated here.",1,0

My understanding of OP's issues is:

She funded the account on creation with 5K.

RH immediately gives them 5k to spend pending the ACH transfer. 

If the ACH fails (bounces) because of NSF in the bank account, then RH will have whatever rights they give themselves from the contract.

However, in that case OP should have all 5k in their bank. 

ACH can be credit OR debit. I do not use ACH for ANY credit based transactions, only debits from my cash reserves.

I doubt you'll make enough profit to pay this month's rent, for example. Trading at 325.00 right now, you could buy one stock and the stock price could go up double, or it could collapse completely. Nobody can say for sure, but in my opinion the crash is imminent and any increase in stock value will be nothing compared to the amount it already has increased.

Absolutely massive. If they are forced to try to cover those positions with physical metal, at the same time millions of retail investor muppets are buying up all the physical metal in sight to protect their wealth against the Fed's debasement of the currency, gold & silver bullion could be moon shots. I'm not buying SLV; I'm buying the real thing, knowing that every oz I take out of circulation is one more oz that won't be available to the market-riggers if or when they're forced to cover their shorts. This is one man's considered opinion, not investment advice.

I like the idea of having a thriving online store and here is why.

1.  Freeing up in store space for further product diversification.
2. Free up in store space for live play game space.  Come in, sit down, play D&D.
3. Rise of E-Sports and tapping into that.  Game space for in store tournaments.  People come, watch, play, end up making in store purchases.

Brick and Mortar isn't bad as long as you don't just stop at ""we'll have an online component and that will save us.""

I've seen that fail with SEARS, Lord And Taylor, Nordstrom but they all have one thing in common.  Shitty clothes and bad return policies.  When I worked retail, and everyone should to understand that other people really is Hell, I saw the worst business practices be leading strategies.

One thing in common:  Never updated the stores to match the times.  Each one of them had an old, dirty, a sex crime happened here vibe.  Generally unpleasant.

SEARS:  Junk clothes, junk jewelry, shifted away from real money makers.  Pushing in store credit with high risk customers left a lot of unsecured debt out there.  Poor management and poor customer service.  Liberal as fuck return policy on par with Hecht's which was literally a receiving house for stolen goods at one point.  Sears had a great tool department and auto center but turned most of its locations into knick knack crap stores.  Selling Land's End?  Half the store dedicated to junk clothing line that shares the same sweatshop space as Old Navy.

Lord and Taylor: AKA Hecht's 2.0.  Same shit.  I did doubles working the unloading dock and then sales on the floor.  So they overpaid for poor quality clothing, defective costume jewelry, and compensation for upper management did not reflect the actual work they did.  Middle manager was overworked undersupported.  Upper Manager sipped the corpo kool aid.  Okay so after you unloaded the truck you loaded it up with returns and broken shit that literally fell apart on the rack.  So unsold, unpopular clothing, there was a lot of that, got loaded up as well. It would move on to cheapo retailers, think Marshalls, and failing that boxed up and shipped back to the countries that ironically made the crap for sale there.  The thinking was mitigate losses by selling somewhere.  But all that transporting, time spent packing and unpacking, taking up space and delaying new spring, fall and winter fashions making them outdated when they hit the rack cost them more than just burning it or donating it.

Nordstrom:  Started out high end.  Started replacing high end goods with their product lines.  Shrunk actual high quality clothing and shoes selection.  Nordstrom Rack became the clearing house for crap they couldn't sell.  Men's Suits were incredible if you waited for the ""out of season"" suits to go on sale.  No such thing as an out of season 2 button suit unless its a fucking leisure suit.  Eventually ran itself down trying to cater to bottom dollar customers, which the market is already glutted with that kind of retailer.

How GME is different?  Okay first do you see them pushing high rate store only credit cards?  No.  Do you see them with huge floor space with unmovable product?  No.  Do you see them with a huge floor space and the huge utility bills to match?  No.  Do you see Gamestop with out of control return policies?  No.  

So can Gamestop take it's existing floor space, pivot and reinvent the in store experience?  Yes.  Is Gamestop a distressed stock instead of a distressed company?  Arguably it was a distressed stock, which Cramer himself will tell you is worth buying I've heard him say it.  The above retailers were all distressed companies, that's a no go.  But Wallstreet missed seeing the difference between the stock and company being distressed.

Now for my favorite X Factor of all.  Post COVID life.  Do you think people will flood the malls, bars, entertainment venues, and other spaces after we can all get back outside?  You bet your fucking tendies and rent free basement at mom's house!  Will that need to get out and run free settle down eventually?  Possibly so.  But after nearly 2 years of being trapped indoors the desire to rush out and be anywhere but home is going to hang around for a bit.  So yes I would like to go to the mall, or outlet, enter a Gamestop and purchase something for the novelty of being a free range human again.

I think Gamestop is going to have more plays in the future than after today!",1,0

You can then pay the $50 to exercise it.   It's a workaround to get shares on brokerages which are limiting quantities.  I did this on friday at the $250 dip.

Am I right in thinking that the brokers/market makers (I assume) who loaned Melvin and co the shares for the shorts have the right to call in the shorted shares but may choose to let Melvin etc drag it out if they wish?   I'm aware they'll be paying exorbitant interest, but if they're willing to bet that in 2-3 weeks time most retail investors will have given up and sold, meaning the squeeze is off, maybe they'll decide to do that if the cost of waiting out 2-3 weeks of interest is (for example) $1bn, whereas the potential cost of rushing to cover next week in a squeeze would amount to say $3bn?  

Additionally, what's the chance of some sort of dodgy arrangement with the market makers (noting their willingness to help the shorters through Thursday's market manipulation) to ease off on interest or give them more time to unwind their positions cheaply?

Essentially what I'm saying is that when I first got here my (probably incorrect) assumption was that the shorters were fucked because there was an actual deadline that they HAD to cover their shorts and so they would be squeezed then - whereas now I think the situation is more one of attrition and 'hopefully the squeeze happens because they decide they can't wait out any longer', and my concern there is, what if they decide that waiting it out is better than initiating the squeeze.",1,0

Listen up ding dongs, the next few days are extremely important for us to do something and stop prolonging the inevitable. 


Lets get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...

##üöÄüöÄFidelity and VanguardüöÄüöÄ##

You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this. 

##SO MOVE THE FUCK AWAY FROM ROBINHOOD AND MAKE YOURSELF AN ACCOUNT AT EITHER OF THE TWO RELIABLE BROKERS. However do not transfer your portfolio as this can take weeks. Instead use RH to only sell once the squeeze is sqoze  @$4200.69 and beyond.##

TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.

Take these next 2 days by the balls and get yourself a new brokerage. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

If you short a stock at 1$ and it goes down to 0$, you made 1$ profit. But if the stock goes up to 100$, you made 99$ loss.

So the loss potential is potentially infinate and simply has to do with how high the price of the stock gains.

**Get ready for GME and AMC FUD (Fear Uncertainty Doubt) campaigns on the weekend. It's already starting.**

The number of posts with supposed ""level headed"" advice about how a short squeeze is much more difficult to achieve than we all think, how other stocks are also valuable, and how the strong and powerful hedge funds have much more cards up their sleeve and to ""rethink your strategy"" but still ""Go $GME!! I am one of you guys!"", usually with a few rewards sticked to them, is exploding and will be getting progressively worse in the weekend most certainly.

Does a post sow Fear, or Uncertainty, or Doubt in any way in you? Think for yourself.

Hedge Fund interns have now learned how reddit works and want to part you with your $GME shares.

2021-01-30 22:38:59,29da65cff1fa,Hedge Fund Billionaire Claims Americans Are 'Getting Checks From The Government' And Investing 'To Attack Wealthy People',"The country club assholes dont like that the poors are making some money off this deal. So when melvin collects 20 switches at inflated prices, he delivers the first 20 owed to the country club members.

So the country club members decide to sell those 20 switches back to melvin for $250. A little more than the $200 they paid, but way less than the town poors are asking. Melvin then delivers 20 switches to the next bunch of country club members in line, and those members do the exact same thing. Melvin obviously takes a bit of a bath on the whole thing, but way less than buying back every switch from the townspeople.

I actually don't know anything about stocks, but i'm trying to think of a way out for melvin in this analogy. Is there a way this could work in the stock market? Can wall street collude to save melvin? (Obviously they are trying with the halts and the bullshit... But is there a way for institutions to sell enough shares back to melvin without paying WSB?)

Listen up ding dongs, the next few days are extremely important for us to do something and stop prolonging the inevitable. 


Lets get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...

##üöÄüöÄFidelity and VanguardüöÄüöÄ##

You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this. 

##SO MOVE THE FUCK AWAY FROM ROBINHOOD AND MAKE YOURSELF AN ACCOUNT AT EITHER OF THE TWO RELIABLE BROKERS. However do not transfer your portfolio as this can take weeks. Instead use RH to only sell once the squeeze is sqoze  @$4200.69 and beyond.##

TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.

Take these next 2 days by the balls and get yourself a new brokerage. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

I like the idea of having a thriving online store and here is why.

1.  Freeing up in store space for further product diversification.
2. Free up in store space for live play game space.  Come in, sit down, play D&D.
3. Rise of E-Sports and tapping into that.  Game space for in store tournaments.  People come, watch, play, end up making in store purchases.

Brick and Mortar isn't bad as long as you don't just stop at ""we'll have an online component and that will save us.""

I've seen that fail with SEARS, Lord And Taylor, Nordstrom but they all have one thing in common.  Shitty clothes and bad return policies.  When I worked retail, and everyone should to understand that other people really is Hell, I saw the worst business practices be leading strategies.

One thing in common:  Never updated the stores to match the times.  Each one of them had an old, dirty, a sex crime happened here vibe.  Generally unpleasant.

SEARS:  Junk clothes, junk jewelry, shifted away from real money makers.  Pushing in store credit with high risk customers left a lot of unsecured debt out there.  Poor management and poor customer service.  Liberal as fuck return policy on par with Hecht's which was literally a receiving house for stolen goods at one point.  Sears had a great tool department and auto center but turned most of its locations into knick knack crap stores.  Selling Land's End?  Half the store dedicated to junk clothing line that shares the same sweatshop space as Old Navy.

Lord and Taylor: AKA Hecht's 2.0.  Same shit.  I did doubles working the unloading dock and then sales on the floor.  So they overpaid for poor quality clothing, defective costume jewelry, and compensation for upper management did not reflect the actual work they did.  Middle manager was overworked undersupported.  Upper Manager sipped the corpo kool aid.  Okay so after you unloaded the truck you loaded it up with returns and broken shit that literally fell apart on the rack.  So unsold, unpopular clothing, there was a lot of that, got loaded up as well. It would move on to cheapo retailers, think Marshalls, and failing that boxed up and shipped back to the countries that ironically made the crap for sale there.  The thinking was mitigate losses by selling somewhere.  But all that transporting, time spent packing and unpacking, taking up space and delaying new spring, fall and winter fashions making them outdated when they hit the rack cost them more than just burning it or donating it.

Nordstrom:  Started out high end.  Started replacing high end goods with their product lines.  Shrunk actual high quality clothing and shoes selection.  Nordstrom Rack became the clearing house for crap they couldn't sell.  Men's Suits were incredible if you waited for the ""out of season"" suits to go on sale.  No such thing as an out of season 2 button suit unless its a fucking leisure suit.  Eventually ran itself down trying to cater to bottom dollar customers, which the market is already glutted with that kind of retailer.

How GME is different?  Okay first do you see them pushing high rate store only credit cards?  No.  Do you see them with huge floor space with unmovable product?  No.  Do you see them with a huge floor space and the huge utility bills to match?  No.  Do you see Gamestop with out of control return policies?  No.  

So can Gamestop take it's existing floor space, pivot and reinvent the in store experience?  Yes.  Is Gamestop a distressed stock instead of a distressed company?  Arguably it was a distressed stock, which Cramer himself will tell you is worth buying I've heard him say it.  The above retailers were all distressed companies, that's a no go.  But Wallstreet missed seeing the difference between the stock and company being distressed.

Now for my favorite X Factor of all.  Post COVID life.  Do you think people will flood the malls, bars, entertainment venues, and other spaces after we can all get back outside?  You bet your fucking tendies and rent free basement at mom's house!  Will that need to get out and run free settle down eventually?  Possibly so.  But after nearly 2 years of being trapped indoors the desire to rush out and be anywhere but home is going to hang around for a bit.  So yes I would like to go to the mall, or outlet, enter a Gamestop and purchase something for the novelty of being a free range human again.

I think Gamestop is going to have more plays in the future than after today!",1,0

(Yeah, out there, somewhere, there's other cognitively challenged, educationally subnormal people just like us. Swoon.)

I've set up a GoFundMe for the cause. Every single cent, dime, penny, dollar, euro and pound will be used to purchase GME with all proceeds going to Shelter and St. Mungo's, two amazing UK homeless charities struggling through the pandemic.

Sell limits for the charity donations to be dictated by r/wallstreetbets degen consensus.

I have personal $GME and $AMC bags because my ex-girlfriends' affection-starved ex-boyfriend used to talk about how much he loved the stonk in his sleep. 

I'll keep buying the top, set no limits, and HOLD to infinity. Being economically challenged, I never understood the value of paper anyhow.

They're just trying to get your attention, and they're succeeding! üö®","I like the analogy, but something I'm currently not quite clear on is the issue of the shorts not actually having an expiry date. 

Am I right in thinking that the brokers/market makers (I assume) who loaned Melvin and co the shares for the shorts have the right to call in the shorted shares but may choose to let Melvin etc drag it out if they wish?   I'm aware they'll be paying exorbitant interest, but if they're willing to bet that in 2-3 weeks time most retail investors will have given up and sold, meaning the squeeze is off, maybe they'll decide to do that if the cost of waiting out 2-3 weeks of interest is (for example) $1bn, whereas the potential cost of rushing to cover next week in a squeeze would amount to say $3bn?  

Additionally, what's the chance of some sort of dodgy arrangement with the market makers (noting their willingness to help the shorters through Thursday's market manipulation) to ease off on interest or give them more time to unwind their positions cheaply?

Essentially what I'm saying is that when I first got here my (probably incorrect) assumption was that the shorters were fucked because there was an actual deadline that they HAD to cover their shorts and so they would be squeezed then - whereas now I think the situation is more one of attrition and 'hopefully the squeeze happens because they decide they can't wait out any longer', and my concern there is, what if they decide that waiting it out is better than initiating the squeeze.",1,0

Listen up ding dongs, the next few days are extremely important for us to do something and stop prolonging the inevitable. 


Lets get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...

##üöÄüöÄFidelity and VanguardüöÄüöÄ##

You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this. 

##SO MOVE THE FUCK AWAY FROM ROBINHOOD AND MAKE YOURSELF AN ACCOUNT AT EITHER OF THE TWO RELIABLE BROKERS. However do not transfer your portfolio as this can take weeks. Instead use RH to only sell once the squeeze is sqoze  @$4200.69 and beyond.##

TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.

Take these next 2 days by the balls and get yourself a new brokerage. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

If you short a stock at 1$ and it goes down to 0$, you made 1$ profit. But if the stock goes up to 100$, you made 99$ loss.

So the loss potential is potentially infinate and simply has to do with how high the price of the stock gains.

**Get ready for GME and AMC FUD (Fear Uncertainty Doubt) campaigns on the weekend. It's already starting.**

The number of posts with supposed ""level headed"" advice about how a short squeeze is much more difficult to achieve than we all think, how other stocks are also valuable, and how the strong and powerful hedge funds have much more cards up their sleeve and to ""rethink your strategy"" but still ""Go $GME!! I am one of you guys!"", usually with a few rewards sticked to them, is exploding and will be getting progressively worse in the weekend most certainly.

Melvin then delivers 20 switches to the next bunch of country club members in line, and those members do the exact same thing.

Listen up ding dongs, the next few days are extremely important for us to do something and stop prolonging the inevitable. 


Lets get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...

##üöÄüöÄFidelity and VanguardüöÄüöÄ##

You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this. 

##SO MOVE THE FUCK AWAY FROM ROBINHOOD AND MAKE YOURSELF AN ACCOUNT AT EITHER OF THE TWO RELIABLE BROKERS. However do not transfer your portfolio as this can take weeks. Instead use RH to only sell once the squeeze is sqoze  @$4200.69 and beyond.##

TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.

Take these next 2 days by the balls and get yourself a new brokerage. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
